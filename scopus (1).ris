AB  - Meaning-constitution and creativity processes in contemporary culture have obviously been changed under the artificial intelligence’s conditions as “natural-ar-tificial intelligence” system starts to contribute to creativity as meaning-constitu-tion and creativity processes. Аrtificial intelligence seems to be a relatively young actor in the human culture. Its conceptual framing as well as its philosophical contribution to meaning-constitution processes requires special research efforts. Search for the new ways of meaning-constitution conceptual framing in conceptual culture’s horizon, is consists of different actors including artificial intelligence facilities, already posed numerous epistemological and ethical problems, is the purpose of the present research. Research strategy and meaning-con-stitution analysis requires to separate meaning-constitution approaches in contemporary research tradition on micro-and macro-levels. As for micro-level approaches to consciousness are concerned, I arrive to the conclusion, that artificial intelligence contribution in creativity processes requires macro-level approach to contemporary culture. I am trying to analyze artificial intelligence – within the framework of the macro-level approach – as a special actor, sophisticated phenomenological contemplations and B. Latur’s actor-network theory being relevant to the study of this subject matter. © 2021.

AB  - Accurate localization of complex human experiences such as emotions, dreaming, creativity, and consciousness to specific cerebral structures or neural networks has remained elusive despite technological advances. We report the use of acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) to evoke behavioral and emotional effects by applying electrical stimulation (ES) at various voltage strengths to the basolateral and central subnuclei of the amygdala in addition to the head of hippocampus (HC) for two subjects with medically refractory post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our results suggest that the amygdala could be a node in a neural network responsible for the generation of complex vivid mental imagery and integrated sensory experiences similar to John Hughlings Jackson’s “dreamy state” and “double consciousness,” which have been classically associated with temporal lobe epilepsy during uncinate seizures. That we were able to elicit similar vivid, dynamic, complex, bizarre, and original mental imagery with ES in non-epileptic subjects suggests that Jackson’s seizure related “dreamy state” and “double consciousness” may arise from heightened innate brain mechanisms with the amygdala acting as a node in the neural network responsible for physiologic dreaming and creative functions. Furthermore, our subjects experienced different emotions with different stimulation strengths at various electrode contacts. Our results suggest that higher voltage stimulation of the amygdala and HC at 4–5 V leads to predominantly negative responses and 2–4 V stimulation showed inversely coupled positive and negative responses of the amygdala in either hemisphere which may imply hemispheric dominance of emotional valences without relation to handedness. Due to the unique and complex responses dependent on location and strength of stimulation, we advise that all patients receiving DBS of the amygdala undergo acute stimulation mapping in a monitored setting before selecting therapeutic parameters for chronic stimulation. © Copyright © 2020 Lai, Langevin, Koek, Krahl, Bari and Chen.

AB  - The emergence of two distinct leadership roles, the task leader and the socio-emotional leader, has been documented in the leadership literature since the 1950s. Recent research in neuroscience suggests that the division between task-oriented and socio-emotional oriented roles derives from a fundamental feature of our neurobiology: an antagonistic relationship between two large-scale cortical networks - the task-positive network (TPN) and the default mode network (DMN). Neural activity in TPN tends to inhibit activity in the DMN, and vice versa. The TPN is important for problem solving, focusing of attention, making decisions, and control of action. The DMN plays a central role in emotional self-awareness, social cognition, and ethical decision making. It is also strongly linked to creativity and openness to new ideas. Because activation of the TPN tends to suppress activity in the DMN, an over-emphasis on task-oriented leadership may prove deleterious to social and emotional aspects of leadership. Similarly, an overemphasis on the DMN would result in difficulty focusing attention, making decisions, and solving known problems. In this paper, we will review major streams of theory and research on leadership roles in the context of recent findings from neuroscience and psychology. We conclude by suggesting that emerging research challenges the assumption that role differentiation is both natural and necessary, in particular when openness to new ideas, people, emotions, and ethical concerns are important to success. © 2014 Boyatzis, Rochford and Jack.

AB  - A recent interpretation of artificial intelligence (AI) (Floridi 2013, 2022) suggests that the implementation of AI demands the investigation of the binding conditions that make it possible to build and integrate artifacts into our lived world. Such artifacts can successfully interact with the world because our environment has been designed to be compatible with intelligent machines (such as robots). As the use of AI becomes ubiquitous in society, possibly leading to the formation of increasingly intelligent bio-technological unions, there will likely be a coexistence of a plethora of micro-environments wrapped and tailored around humans and basic robots. The key element of this pervasive process will be the capacity to integrate biological realms in an infosphere suitable for the implementation of AI technologies. This process will require extensive datafication. This is because data is the basis of the logical-mathematical codes and models that drive and guide AI. This process will have huge consequences on workplaces, on workers, as well as on the decision-making processes required for the functioning of future societies. In this paper we will offer a comprehensive reflection on the moral and social implications of datafication as well as a set of considerations about its desirability, which will be informed by the following insights: (1) full protection of privacy may become structurally impossible, thus leading to undesirable forms of political and social control; (2) worker’s freedom may be reduced; (3) human creativity, imagination, and even divergence from AI logic might be channeled and possibly discouraged; (4) there will likely be a push towards efficiency and instrumental reason, which will become preeminent in production lines as well as in society. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly impacting various aspects of our daily lives, including education. With the rise of digital technologies, higher education has also been experiencing a transformation, and AI has been playing a crucial role in this transformation. The application of AI in higher education has been rapidly increasing, with a focus on improving student engagement, increasing efficiency, and enhancing the learning experience. The use of AI in higher education is not without its challenges and ethical considerations. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring the accuracy and fairness of AI algorithms, as well as avoiding potential biases. In addition, there are concerns about the privacy of student data, as well as the potential for AI to replace human instructors and support staff. Another challenge is ensuring that AI is used in a way that supports the overall goals of higher education, such as promoting critical thinking and creativity, rather than just being used as a tool for automating tasks and increasing efficiency. In this article, we will discuss the various ways in which AI is being applied in higher education where a proposed model for improving the cognitive capability of students is proposed and compared to other existing algorithms. It will be shown that the proposed model shows better performance compared to other models. © 2023 The Author

AB  - Scientific discovery is a driving force for progress involving creative problem-solving processes to further our understanding of the world. The process of scientific discovery has historically been intensive and time-consuming; however, advances in computational power and algorithms have provided an efficient route to make new discoveries. Complex tools using artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently analyze data as well as generate new hypotheses and theories. Along with AI becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives and the services we access, its application to different scientific domains is becoming more widespread. For example, AI has been used for the early detection of medical conditions, identifying treatments and vaccines (e.g., against COVID-19), and predicting protein structure. The application of AI in psychological science has started to become popular. AI can assist in new discoveries both as a tool that allows more freedom to scientists to generate new theories and by making creative discoveries autonomously. Conversely, psychological concepts such as heuristics have refined and improved artificial systems. With such powerful systems, however, there are key ethical and practical issues to consider. This article addresses the current and future directions of computational scientific discovery generally and its applications in psychological science more specifically. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - ENGAbstract:This article discusses the emergence of generative models of image creation based on artificial intelligence (AI) and how they work by converting natural language descriptions (prompts) into images. Particular emphasis is placed on the ethical issues involved in the training processes of these systems. The risks that these generative models catalyse a devaluation of human creativity in various dimensions and that the generalisation of their use promotes an increasingly derivative and inauthentic visual culture are central to this article. Likewise, in the final part, we describe some avenues of current visual creation centred on the critical thematisation of artificial intelligence, which situate the relationship between art and AI not so much in the exploitation of the latter’s creative (combinatory, derivative) capacity as in the poetic and critical enquiry into its effects on the production of our subjectivity. © 2024 Universidad Compultense Madrid.

AB  - Technology has greatly influenced and radically changed human life, from communication to creativity and from productivity to entertainment. The authors, starting from considerations concerning the implementation of new technologies with a strong impact on people’s everyday lives, take up Collingridge’s dilemma and relate it to the application of AI in healthcare. Collingridge’s dilemma is an ethical and epistemological problem concerning the relationship between technology and society which involves two approaches. The proactive approach and socio-technological experimentation taken into account in the dilemma are discussed, the former taking health technology assessment (HTA) processes as a reference and the latter the AI studies conducted so far. As a possible prevention of the critical issues raised, the use of the medico-legal method is proposed, which classically lies between the prevention of possible adverse events and the reconstruction of how these occurred. The authors believe that this methodology, adopted as a European guideline in the medico-legal field for the assessment of medical liability, can be adapted to AI applied to the healthcare scenario and used for the assessment of liability issues. The topic deserves further investigation and will certainly be taken into consideration as a possible key to future scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The paper traces the development of the discussion around ethical issues in artificial intelligence, and considers the way in which humans have affected the knowledge bases used in machine learning The phenomenon of bias or discrimination in machine ethics is seen as inherited from humans, either through the use of biased data or through the semantics inherent in intellectually-built tools sourced by intelligent agents. The kind of biases observed in AI are compared with those identified in the field of knowledge organization, using religious adherents as an example of a community potentially marginalized by bias. A practical demonstration is given of apparent religious prejudice inherited from source material in a large database deployed widely in computational linguistics and automatic indexing Methods to address the problem of bias are discussed, including the modelling of the moral process on neuroscientific understanding of brain function. The question is posed whether it is possible to model religious belief in a similar way, so that robots of the future may have both an ethical and a religious sense and themselves address the problem of prejudice. © 2019 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - The twenty-first century has brought with it a growing variety of authentic and engaging learning environments. While significant portions of human learning still take place in traditional classrooms, researchers and educators have innovated several learning experiences that are embodied, project-based, inquiry-driven, collaborative, and open-ended. Furthermore, there has been greater acknowledgement of the varying timescales and contexts where meaningful learning takes place, as well as greater attention to previously underappreciated competencies like creativity, self-regulation, and collaboration. This expansion in the types, contexts, and timescales of human learning necessitate novel analytic approaches. This chapter will discuss how artificial intelligence-based tools and technologies can help researchers and practitioners navigate and enact these novel approaches to learning, while also providing a meaningful lens for student reflection and inquiry. Consequently, this chapter includes discussions of (1) technologies that provide learners with a broader set of modalities to showcase their knowledge, (2) tools that offer insights within groups of students using audio/video information, and (3) analytic techniques and interfaces for helping researchers collect and analyze different types of multimodal data across contexts. The chapter will also discuss some of the ethics surrounding these types of data and analytic approaches. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - In this paper I explore the cognitive aspects of artefactual creativity in new media art. Starting with a concept of combinatorial inventiveness which is central to artefactual creativity, I summarize its roles in the arts and culture, leading to its applications in new media art. With regards to the diversity of practices in this domain, I focus on generative art projects created primarily by processing the material from cinema, television and the Internet. These projects blend procedural thinking with bricolage, leverage complex technical infrastructures, foster curiosity and encourage vigilance in our critical appreciation of the arts, technology, culture, society, and human nature. I discuss their methodologies, poetic features, cultural and social contexts in three sections which exemplify the effects and consequences of computational paradigm: Database logic, statistical abstraction, and quantification. Throughout each section, I outline the theoretical considerations that can be educed from the examples, and expand on them in the concluding section which examines the artists’ creative motives and circumstances for analogizing and meaning making in relation to the cognitive and ethical implications of generative new media art. © 2020, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa.

AB  - With the recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, services such as automatic writing evaluation (AWE) and AI-assisted writing have been developed. AWE is often used in education to correct grammar. Unlike AWE, AI-assisted writing is a service that generates content for users. Currently, being a new field, research on AI-assisted writing is insufficient compared to studies on AWE. This study derives user experience factors of AI-assisted writing through a literature review and checks the difference in experience according to the writing case and creativity level. Seven user experience factors were derived through literature research, and the factors were evaluated for “Rytr,” an assisted writing service. Thirty-six subjects participated in an online survey. Four prototypes were designed and provided according to the writing case (e-mail, story plot) and creativity level (high, low) of text generation, and a two-way ANOVA was conducted based on survey data. A significant difference was found for each creativity level and writing case. Users obtained more creative writing results when writing a story plot and thought positively about the assisted writing service. In the AI-assisted writing service, the users experienced increased trust and satisfaction when writing a story plot. This study can help design functions based on various types of writing, considering user experience in developing AI-assisted writing services in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - AI has long been regarded as a panacea for decision-making and many other aspects of knowledge work; as something that will help humans get rid of their shortcomings. We believe that AI can be a useful asset to support decision-makers, but not that it should replace decision-makers. Decision-making uses algorithmic analysis, but it is not solely algorithmic analysis; it also involves other factors, many of which are very human, such as creativity, intuition, emotions, feelings, and value judgments. We have conducted semi-structured open-ended research interviews with 17 dermatologists to understand what they expect from an AI application to deliver to medical diagnosis. We have found four aggregate dimensions along which the thinking of dermatologists can be described: the ways in which our participants chose to interact with AI, responsibility, ‘explainability’, and the new way of thinking (mindset) needed for working with AI. We believe that our findings will help physicians who might consider using AI in their diagnosis to understand how to use AI beneficially. It will also be useful for AI vendors in improving their understanding of how medics want to use AI in diagnosis. Further research will be needed to examine if our findings have relevance in the wider medical field and beyond. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In this slide-lecture we formulate a novel paradigm for the mathematical description of mental functions such as consciousness, creativity, decision making and prediction of the future based on the past. Such cognitive functions are described in the framework of canonical nonlinear dynamical models that form joint global hierarchical networks. Subnetworks cooperate and compete with each other by inhibition. The suggested approach uses heteroclinic dynamics to represent transitivity and sequential interaction of different cognitive modalities at all levels of network hierarchy. For the first time we build a model of global network dynamics based on a set of kinetic ecological equations describing the interaction with emotion at each level of the hierarchy. This makes the model applicable for the description and understanding of perception, creativity and other complex cognitive processes. We discuss the creativity phenomenon, for example, in a joint ≪human-robot mind≫ considering the approximation in which the artificial partner is responsible for the binding and retrieving of multimodal perception information. The formation of chunks and the creation of workingmemory is a joint effort-human-robot mind. The human mind is responsible for the evaluation of the information in working memory. Creativity is estimated by Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. As an example, we discuss joint human-robot musical improvisation, which can be generalized for many applications, in particular, in the context of artificial intelligence applications and to address several psychiatric disorders. © 2017 Izvestiya Vysshikh Uchebnykh Zavedeniy.

AB  - Dualisms are pervasive. The divisions between the rational mind, the physical body, and the external natural world have set the stage for the successes and failures of contemporary cognitive science and artificial intelligence.1 Advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed to draw art and compose music. Many take these facts as calls for a radical shift in our values and turn to questions about AI ethics, rights, and personhood. While the discussion of agency and rights is not wrong in principle, it is a form of misdirection in the current circumstances. Questions about an artificial agency can only come after a genuine reconciliation of human interactivity, creativity, and embodiment. This kind of challenge has both moral and theoretical force. In this article, the authors intend to contribute to embodied and enactive approaches to AI by exploring the interactive and contingent dimensions of machines through the lens of Japanese philosophy. One important takeaway from this project is that AI/ML systems should be recognized as powerful tools or instruments rather than as agents themselves. © MIT Press Journals. All rights reserved.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) primarily due to the ground-breaking achievements in deep learning and machine learning. A growing number of scholars from cartography have demonstrated successfully that GeoAI can accelerate previously complex cartographic design tasks and even enable cartographic creativity in new ways. Despite the promise of GeoAI, researchers and practitioners have growing concerns about the ethical issues of GeoAI for cartography. In this paper, we conducted a systematic content analysis and narrative synthesis of research studies integrating GeoAI and cartography to summarize current research and development trends regarding the usage of GeoAI for cartographic design. Based on this review and synthesis, we first identify dimensions of GeoAI methods for cartography such as data sources, data formats, map evaluations, and six contemporary GeoAI models, each of which serves a variety of cartographic tasks. These models include decision trees, knowledge graph and semantic web technologies, deep convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Further, we summarize seven cartographic design applications where GeoAI have been effectively employed: generalization, symbolization, typography, map reading, map interpretation, map analysis, and map production. We also raise five potential ethical challenges that need to be addressed in the integration of GeoAI for cartography: commodification, responsibility, privacy, bias, and (together) transparency, explainability, and provenance. We conclude by identifying four potential research directions for future cartographic research with GeoAI: GeoAI-enabled active cartographic symbolism, human-in-the-loop GeoAI for cartography, GeoAI-based mapping-as-a-service, and generative GeoAI for cartography. © 2024 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence development is mainly directed toward imitating human reasoning and performing different tasks. For that purpose, related software and program solution where artificial intelligence is used have mostly thinking abilities. However, there are many questions to answer in ongoing AI research, especially when we come to the point which is addressing humanlike behaviour and reasoning triggered by emotions. In this paper, we are presenting an interactive installation Botorikko: Machine Create State, which is part of the Syntropic Counterpoints art/research project. We are exposing AI cyber clones to some of the fundamental questions for humankind and challenge their creativity. The robots are trained by using the publications Machiavelli and Sun Tzu and confronted to the crucial questions related to moral, ethic, strategy, politics, diplomacy, war etc. We are using a recurrent neural network (RNN) and robot-robot interaction to trigger unsupervised robot creativity and humanlike behaviour on generated machine-made content. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.

AB  - Deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been employed widely in computational creativity research. However, such models discourage out-of-distribution generation to avoid spurious sample generation, thereby limiting their creativity. Thus, incorporating research on human creativity into generative deep learning techniques presents an opportunity to make their outputs more compelling and human-like. As we see the emergence of generative models directed toward creativity research, a need for machine learning-based surrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is imperative. We propose group-based subset scanning to identify, quantify, and characterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous node-activations in the hidden layers of the generative models. Our experiments on the standard image benchmarks, and their “creatively generated” variants, reveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for detecting novelty in creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel space. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of anomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets. The node activations highlighted during the creative decoding process are different from those responsible for the normal sample generation. Lastly, we assess if the images from the subsets selected by our method were also found creative by human evaluators, presenting a link between creativity perception in humans and node activations within deep neural nets. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

TI  - Combining discipline-specific introduction to engineering courses into a single multi-discipline course to foster the entrepreneurial mindset with entrepreneurially minded learning
PY  - 2014

UR  - https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905158321&partnerID=40&md5=ab1426eede21e23361840298c607089f
AB  - This paper focuses on two initiatives: fostering the entrepreneurial mindset in the first year introduction to engineering course and successfully combining discipline-specific courses into a multi-discipline course. While most first year introduction to engineering courses focus on design and problem solving, at the same time familiarizing the student with basic technical content, very few also focus on the entrepreneurial mindset - A way of thinking increasingly required of engineers entering the workforce. Skills associated with the entrepreneurial mindset such as effective communication (written, verbal, and graphical), teamwork, ethics and ethical decision-making, customer awareness, persistence, creativity, innovation, time management, critical thinking, global awareness, self-directed research, life-long learning, learning through failure, tolerance for ambiguity, and estimation are as important in the workforce as technical aptitude. In fact, employer feedback has indicated that graduates with these skills are more highly sought than those with an overly technical education since technical engineering skills can be readily obtained on the job; the entrepreneurial mindset takes years of practice/refinement. Although students may eventually begin practicing many entrepreneurial mindset skills in the curriculum especially during a senior project sequence, it is paramount that the importance of the entrepreneurial mindset is stressed in the first year. This paper will include details of how to integrate all of the skills listed here into well-established design projects, homework, and active learning classroom modules in a first year engineering course using entrepreneurially minded learning. Informal interviews with students reveals successful implementation. As the lines between engineering disciplines are becoming more blurry, employers also covet engineering graduates whose technical skills span a variety of disciplines. Engineers must work on teams that are diverse, and being able to understand and communicate the broad field of engineering is vital to success. Therefore, while completing an engineering degree, students need to become familiar with a multitude of engineering disciplines and work with students from many departments. This is not a new concept and many introduction to engineering courses are interdisciplinary. On the other hand, many colleges still contain only discipline-specific introduction to engineering courses. Over the past year and a half, Lawrence Technological University underwent a successful college-wide transition from many discipline-specific introduction to engineering courses to a multi-discipline course. This paper will outline keys to a successful transition including pitfalls to avoid and working with university administrators, faculty, and staff during the transition. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.

AB  - Retail sales has consistently faced threats by technology throughout history, with the recent advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) posing the most recent challenge. It is often said that because of new technologies, retail salespeople will disappear. In this article, we challenge this assertion by arguing that humans and technology each possess unique strengths and weaknesses, and that each works to affect the customer experience in distinct ways. Specifically, AI elevates the baseline customer experience by improving service consistency, operational efficiency, and multitasking capabilities, thereby “raising the floor” of the customer experience while human salespeople, possessing unique strengths in building customer relationships, showcasing adaptive creativity, and adhering to ethical considerations, expand the upper limits of potential customer experiences thereby “raising the ceiling” of the customer experience. We propose a synergistic future where AI and human salespeople complement each other, with human potential ultimately prevailing in delivering a superior customer experience that can be approximated, but not fully replicated by AI. Building upon this premise, we present real-world examples of retailers that embody these synergies, and we advocate and assess these instances through the lens of the “seven Cs” representing core customer experience needs: (1) curation, (2) customization, (3) community, (4) cost, (5) customer retailtainment, (6) convenience, and (7) category expertise. Finally, we discuss managerial considerations and propose directions for future research. © 2023 New York University

AB  - Human relationships and bonding reconfigure and reinvent themselves over time. For several decades, it has been interesting to note that both the digital dimension and the development of artificial intelligence have played a great evolutionary role in our relational society. There is an accessibility and intensification of social exchanges between internet users (published writings, photos, conversations, conferences… ). Although we access this interplanetary sharing of connection, despite everything the distancing and physical emotional social deprivation between several individuals belonging to a different household can bring significantly high suffering. Moreover, with the Covid-19 crisis, there has also been that fragility of our own personal doubt that will settle psychically in us: the uncertainty will be more intimate, more present and more distressing. If there is exposure to a potentially threatening stimulus as is the case with COVID-19, the exploration of positive or negative resources of survival and that of creativity (psychological capital) will emerge during this first increasedmajor confinement in order to bring non-negligible and bearable psychic responses to possible traumas and episodes of acute stress. However, the goal of this article is to propose a possible understanding of a resilience, thought and mobilized from a systemic approach: The relationship between the individual and his different systems of social, relational and existential belonging. © 2021 L'Encéphale, Paris

AB  - Background: In the rapid evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), scientific publishing is experiencing significant transformations. AI tools, while offering unparalleled efficiencies in paper drafting and peer review, also introduce notable ethical concerns. Content: This study delineates AI’s dual role in scientific publishing: as a co-creator in the writing and review of scientific papers and as an ethical challenge. We first explore the potential of AI as an enhancer of efficiency, efficacy, and quality in creating scientific papers. A critical assessment follows, evaluating the risks vs. rewards for researchers, especially those early in their careers, emphasizing the need to maintain a balance between AI’s capabilities and fostering independent reasoning and creativity. Subsequently, we delve into the ethical dilemmas of AI’s involvement, particularly concerning originality, plagiarism, and preserving the genuine essence of scientific discourse. The evolving dynamics further highlight an overlooked aspect: the inadequate recognition of human reviewers in the academic community. With the increasing volume of scientific literature, tangible metrics and incentives for reviewers are proposed as essential to ensure a balanced academic environment. Summary: AI’s incorporation in scientific publishing is promising yet comes with significant ethical and operational challenges. The role of human reviewers is accentuated, ensuring authenticity in an AI-influenced environment. Outlook: As the scientific community treads the path of AI integration, a balanced symbiosis between AI’s efficiency and human discernment is pivotal. Emphasizing human expertise, while exploit artificial intelligence responsibly, will determine the trajectory of an ethically sound and efficient AI-augmented future in scientific publishing. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely assumed to transform industries and occupations in them in the decade to come. Scholarly literature has addressed the phenomenon by studies of computerization across an array of jobs (Frey and Osborne, 2013) as well depictions of the the way AI does the transformation (e.g. Bessen, 2018). There are also studiest on specific occupational contexts such as managerial work and medical profession. This paper recapitulates the findings of three separate futures studies that addressed the potentials of AI-driven change in three distinct areas, which all have traditionally contained a strong human-based element. The primary data for the study was collected via qualitative interview on experts of both application areas as well as AI technology development. The data analyses relied on content analysis via thematic coding and presented using scenarios. The professional areas studied were primary medical care (human rights and human touch), recruitment function within HRM (human resources) and music composing (human creativity). The results of the study offers view on parallels and discrepancies in the AI-supported future between occupations, factors that may spark or slow down the AI-intrusion to the fields in focus. The results are illustrated to depict the joint potential opportunities as well as challenges in AI use and also the industry-specific benefits and challenges not shared with other domains of activity. The indication is that despite the common basic tenets of the technology, the goals and potential benefits differ in occupational contexts. The research also signals worries on legal and ethical dimensions i.e. rights and responsibilities in AI interventions to work processes across occupational areas. The research contributes to research streams of process management, technology acceptance and ethics. The research gives also gives pragmatic guidance to AI technology and solutions developers as well as to the organizations and professionals deploying AI-based technologies. © 2021 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2021.

AB  - A workshop held at the 18th Annual Conference of the Pharmaceutical Contract Management Group in Krakow on 9 September 2022 asked over 200 delegates what the clinical trial landscape would look like in 2050. Issues considered included who will be running the pharmaceutical industry in 2050; how ‘health chips’, wearables and diagnostics will impact on finding the right patients to study; how will artificial intelligence be designing and controlling clinical trials; and what will the role of the Clinical Research Associate, the critical observer, documenter and conductor of a clinical trial need to look like by 2050. The consensus was that, by 2050, if you are working in clinical trials, you will be a data scientist. We can expect to see an increasing role of new technologies and a new three-phase registration model for novel therapies. The first phase will involve an aspect of quality evaluation and biological proof-of-concept probably involving more preclinical modelling and engineered human cell lines and fewer animal studies than currently used. Once registered, new products will enter a period of adaptive clinical development (delivered as a single study) intended to establish safety. This phase will most likely take around 1–2 years and explore tailored options for administration. Investigations will most likely be conducted in patients, possibly in a ‘patient-in-a-box’ setting (hospital or healthcare centre, virtual or microsite). On completion of safety licencing, drugs will begin an assessment of efficacy in partnership with those responsible for reimbursement – testing will be performed in patients, possibly where individual patient involvement in safety testing will offer some reimbursement deal for future treatment. Change is coming, though its precise form will likely depend on the creativity and vision of sponsors, regulators and payers.

AB  - Turing's landmark paper on computing machinery and intelligence is multifaceted and has an underemphasized ethical dimension. Turing's notion of "intelligence" and "thinking" was far more encompassing than the common anthropocentric view may suggest. We discuss a number of open and underrated problems that the common interpretation of the Turing test as a test of machine intelligence entails. We suggest that a more meaningful question than "Can machines think?" is whether modern computing machinery can amplify human intelligence. We cite examples ranging from traditional silicon-based environments to carbon-based, living organisms in order to illustrate that this kind of intelligence amplification is indeed happening today. We conclude that in its interpretation as a test of machine intelligence, the Turing test may indeed be harmful for artificial intelligence (AI); in its wider interpretation, however, it remains an inspiring source for philosophy and AI alike.

AB  - This manuscript illustrates the computational intelligence used in indoor environmental art design to enhance the natural living environment and increase the quality of life for residents. The framework is responsible for indoor environmental art ecological design concepts of three areas of environmental coordination, reprocessing and people-oriented planning and development. These design concepts are paying attention to the development of ecological architecture, protecting the environment material implementation, and the natural environment, to provide designers with certain new concepts of the art design. The indoor environmental art design characteristics such as a reasonable plan to build indoor, rational, and scientific spaces, using artistic creativity to create an indoor environment to preserve and ensure the safety of the rational activity. In this framework, the Hybrid Conformal Prediction Algorithm Framework (HCPAF) used to achieve the features of the indoor environmental art design. In the interior design process, designers require to learn something about the needs of the consumer by incorporating the idea of sustainable products into the architecture. Artificial intelligence helps to improve the creativity of designers by taking care of the continuous development that saves designers ‘energy and time to create ideas in HCPAF. Concerning the environmental dimensions of city building, the interior architecture of urban design is ultimately the essential material. The environmental art design is aimed at human living spaces where the reasonable and extensive use of resources is avoided, that the natural environment, the social environment, is artistically used. The simulation analysis of the proposed method gives the result of design accuracy as 98%, design execution as 92%, and the error rate of 6% has been evaluated. © 2020

AB  - The increasing uptake of machine learning solutions for segmentation and planning leaves no doubt that artificial intelligence (AI) will soon be providing input into a range of radiotherapy procedures. Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead. © 2019

AB  - "Science is art," said Regina Dugan, senior executive at Google and former director of DARPA. "It is the process of creating something that never exists before. ... It makes us ask new questions about ourselves, others; about ethics, the future." This second volume of the Digital Da Vinci book series leads the discussions on the world's first computer art in the 1950s and the actualization of Star Trek's holodeck in the future with the help of artificial intelligence and cyborgs. In this book, Gavin Sade describes experimental creative practices that bring together arts, science and technology in imaginative ways; Mine Özkar expounds visual computation for good designs based on repetition and variation; Raffaella Folgieri, Claudio Lucchiari, Marco Granato and Daniele Grechi introduce BrainArt, a brain-computer interface that allows users to create drawings using their own cerebral rhythms; Nathan Cohen explores artificially created spaces that enhance spatial awareness and challenge our perception of what we encounter; Keith Armstrong discusses embodied experiences that affect the mind and body of participating audiences; Diomidis Spinellis uses Etoys and Squeak in a scientific experiment to teach the concept of physical computing; Benjamin Cowley explains the massively multiplayer online game "Green My Place" aimed at achieving behavior transformation in energy awareness; Robert Niewiadomski and Dennis Anderson portray 3-D manufacturing as the beginning of common creativity revolution; Stephen Barrass takes 3-D printing to another dimension by fabricating an object from a sound recording; Mari Velonaki examines the element of surprise and touch sensing in human-robot interaction; and Roman Danylak surveys the media machines in light of Marshall McLuhan's dictum "the medium is the message." Digital Da Vinci: Computers in the Arts and Sciences is dedicated to polymathic education and interdisciplinary studies in the digital age empowered by computer science. Educators and researchers ought to encourage the new generation of scholars to become as well rounded as a Renaissance man or woman. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing new possibilities to numerous fields. There have been a lot of discussions about the development of AI technologies and the challenges caused by AI such as job replacement and ethical issues. However, it’s far from enough to systematically discuss how to use AI creatively and how AI can enhance human creativity. After studying over 1,600 application cases across more than 45 areas, and analyzing related academic publications, we believe that focusing on the collaboration with AI will benefit us far more than dwelling on the competing against AI. “AI Creativity” is the concept we want to introduce here: the ability for human and AI to co-live and co-create by playing to each other’s strengths to achieve more. AI is a complement to human intelligence, and it consolidates wisdom from all achievements of mankind, making collaboration across time and space possible. AI empowers us throughout the entire creative process, and makes creativity more accessible and more inclusive than ever. The corresponding Human-AI Co-Creation Model we proposed explains the creative process in the era of AI, with new possibilities brought by AI in each phase. In addition, this model allows any “meaning-making” action to be enhanced by AI and delivered in a more efficient way. The emphasis on collaboration is not only an echo to the importance of teamwork, but is also a push for co-creation between human and AI. The study of application cases shows that AI Creativity has been making significant impact in various fields, bringing new possibilities to human society and individuals, as well as new opportunities and challenges in technology, society and education. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the field of creativity faces new opportunities and challenges. This manifesto explores several scenarios of human–machine collaboration on creative tasks and proposes “fundamental laws of generative AI” to reinforce the responsible and ethical use of AI in the creativity field. Four scenarios are proposed and discussed: “Co-Cre-AI-tion,” “Organic,” “Plagiarism 3.0,” and “Shut down,” each illustrating different possible futures based on the collaboration between humans and machines. In addition, we have incorporated an AI-generated manifesto that also highlights important themes, ranging from accessibility and ethics to cultural sensitivity. The fundamental laws proposed aim to prevent AIs from generating harmful content and competing directly with humans. Creating labels and laws are also highlighted to ensure responsible use of AIs. The positive future of creativity and AI lies in a harmonious collaboration that can benefit everyone, potentially leading to a new level of creative productivity respecting ethical considerations and human values during the creative process. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Up until recently, intellectual creation and inventiveness were purely human activities, and their protection systems, that is, copyright law and patent law, have been built on the basis of motivating and enhancing human creativity. This ancient and self-evident assumption is being challenged due to AI technology today. This article explores the concept of creativity in the field of law from a legal point of view, as well as the impending serious moral and social consequences. In the field of copyright law, intellectual creation is inextricably linked with humans and cannot be replaced by any advanced AI system. This results from the legal definition of work, and in particular from the element of “originality”. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in its rich case law validates this position. In the field of patent law, ingenuity is also associated with a natural person through the moral right of inventorship. Here, however, the inventor’s intellectual endeavor derives from the field of cognition, while fields of human intellect concerning personality in general are not involved in the inventive activity nor are crucial for obtaining a patent. However, it is doubtful whether AI-generated inventions can be protected under patent law for other reasons. Furthermore, decoupling the question of creativity stresses the need for specific legal protection of AI-generated works and inventions. Legislating a sui generis right in order to boost innovation, protect competition and maintain a healthy market for intellectual creations is suggested as the best option. © 2021 Anthoula Papadopoulou.

AB  - Purpose: This chapter aims to unveil the challenges of adopting and using banking chatbots in India and identify the challenges of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) for future banking. Need for the study: Unveiling the challenges of chatbots and ChatGPT in the banking industry in India is crucial to understand the limitations and areas of improvement to enhance customer experience, ensure data security, and maintain regulatory compliance. Methodology: The researchers conducted a narrative review systematically summarising and analysing existing literature on chatbots and ChatGPT, providing a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced in the industry. Findings: The authors identify perceived risk, platform quality, connectivity and infrastructure, data privacy and security, user education and acceptance, existing legacy systems, and regulatory guidelines as the challenges of adopting chatbots. Additionally, the findings reveal that the challenges posed by ChatGPT in future banking include the potential reduction of traditional banking jobs, linguistic diversity, data privacy and security, ethical considerations and bias mitigation, explainability and accountability, integration with existing banking systems, and user trust and acceptance. However, implementing these new technologies also presents opportunities for individuals with unique human skills, such as critical thinking, empathy, and creativity, which are difficult to replace with technology. Practical implications: By minimising the challenges of ChatGPT and chatbots, the banking industry could achieve improved customer service, cost efficiency, automation of routine tasks, and 24/7 availability, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in the banking industry. Additionally, these artificial intelligence (AI) tools enable datadriven insights, personalised experiences, scalability, and efficient handling of large customer volumes, contributing to better decision-making and enhanced customer engagement. © 2024 by Narayanage Jayantha Dewasiri, Karunarathnage Sajith Senaka Nuwansiri Karunarathna, Mananage Shanika Hansini Rathnasiri, D.

AB  - Social media are digitalizing massive amounts of users’ cognitions in terms of timelines and emotional content. Such Big Data opens unprecedented opportunities for investigating cognitive phenomena like perception, personality, and information diffusion but requires suitable interpretable frameworks. Since social media data come from users’ minds, worthy candidates for this challenge are cognitive networks, models of cognition giving structure to mental conceptual associations. This work outlines how cognitive network science can open new, quantitative ways for understanding cognition through online media like: (i) reconstructing how users semantically and emotionally frame events with contextual knowledge unavailable to machine learning, (ii) investigating conceptual salience/prominence through knowledge structure in social discourse; (iii) studying users’ personality traits like openness-to-experience, curiosity, and creativity through language in posts; (iv) bridging cognitive/emotional content and social dynamics via multilayer networks comparing the mindsets of influencers and followers. These advancements combine cognitive-, network- and computer science to understand cognitive mechanisms in both digital and real-world settings but come with limitations concerning representativeness, individual variability, and data integration. Such aspects are discussed along with the ethical implications of manipulating sociocognitive data. In the future, reading cognitions through networks and social media can expose cognitive biases amplified by online platforms and relevantly inform policy-making, education, and markets about complex cognitive trends. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In a variety of areas, including healthcare, banking, and manufacturing, repetitive and rule-based processes are automated using robotic process automation (RPA), a fast developing technology. An overview of RPA's, its uses, limitation, and applications are given in this paper. RPA can lower costs, increase process speed, accuracy, and efficiency, and free up staff to concentrate on jobs of higher value. RPA is frequently used for tasks including data input, billing, and customer care. RPA can't, however, execute activities that call for human judgment, decision-making, or creativity, for instance. The adoption of RPA also needs a sizable initial investment and continual maintenance. This paper also touches on a few RPA-related ethical issues, like employment displacement and data privacy. While RPA has a great deal of promise to alter sectors, its deployment can only be successful if its limitations and ethical implications are carefully considered. © 2024 Slovene Society Informatika.

AB  - Job satisfaction has been a popular topic in research for many decades. The interest in this variable has spanned academic fields that have been broached by psychologists, management, and, more recently, economists. The present study is devoted to evaluating overall job satisfaction by using a fuzzy aggregation and a possibility measure. Many studies have been published in the area of evaluating job satisfaction. However, their methods are insufficient as they are based only on a statistical method. Therefore, perceptual data rather than numbers have been specified in this study concerning the essentials and the basic factors of job satisfaction, including such parameters as activity, independence, variety, status, supervision-human resource, supervision-technical, moral values, security, social service, authority, ability, company policies and practices, compensation, advancement, responsibility, creativity, working conditions, co-workers, recognition, and achievement. It has been proven that information determined by perception can be processed by a more adequate method, e. g., by using a fuzzy logic theory and a possibility measure. © L. Gardashova, 2016.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) affects all aspects of a business, significantly contributing to problem-solving and introducing new operational processes within companies. Interest in AI is growing due to its capacities regarding the efficiency of operations, reduced working time, and quality improvements. However, to ensure proper development, businesses should also address the ethical effects generated by AI technologies. This research aims to identify AI’s ethical impact and associated challenges in the business consulting industry and the consultants’ perspective on AI’s future implementation in their specific sector. The methodology is based on the design of a structural equation modelling using data collected through a survey addressed to business consultants. The results highlight that ethical concerns are positively correlated with the identified harmful consequences of AI, such as high implementation costs, the possibility that this technology will lead to job losses, or a lack of human interaction and creativity. The consultants’ perspective on the future aspects of AI’s use in business consulting is negatively impacted by the following ethical outcomes: discrimination, invasions of privacy, denial of individual autonomy, unjustifiable results, and disintegration of social connection. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Language models are increasingly attracting interest from writers. However, such models lack long-range semantic coherence, limiting their usefulness for longform creative writing. We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically, in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron's usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals. Participants co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections both from our interviewees and from independent reviewers who critiqued performances of several of the scripts to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation could be useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations - including plagiarism and bias - and participatory models for the design and deployment of such tools. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Since 2018, a new terminology has been developed, called Algor-ethics, indicating the necessity for a dedicated study concerning the evaluation of an ethics applied to technology, to Algorithms and to Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the same time, since 1987, when the concept of sustainability was introduced, the discussion on this issue has become increasingly lively and has now spread to every area of life. In this paper, we would like to propose an application of the concept of sustainability to technological processes and in particular to the elaboration of AI systems. To reach this goal we will first try to build an ethical framework, here called Dynamical Techno-Algor-Ethical Composition, to define the interaction between the most important ethical ingredients involving the human person in relation to technology, taking a person-centered approach. Out of this will emerge a possible structure and definition of Technological Sustainability. The second step will consist of evaluating the process for the elaboration of an AI algorithm as a concrete application of the previously analyzed framework, to set ethical contents composing what we might call a good and sustainable algorithm. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Objective: Legal education in Brazil faces a series of challenges to adapt to modern society needs, such as its dogmatism and technicality. In the opposite direction, the World Economic Forum presents that the necessary skills for the job market are behavioral competences, such as the complex problem resolution and creativity. A new layer was added to these challenges, based on the regulatory flexibility that increases the distance workload to undergraduate courses in Law, the effect of the pandemic of COVID-19. So, expand the incorporation of artificial intelligence in distance learning. Therefore, it is questioned what the limits for are incorporating artificial intelligence into distance legal education. Relating these technologies to the requirements of practical reasonableness means responding to the possibility of ethical standards limiting the use of artificial intelligence in distance learning in the legal field. Methodology: We chose to review the literature with a qualitative approach and use of the deductive method, seeking to present an interpretation of the studied phenomenon. The article is divided into three parts to describe the intensification of the crisis in Brazilian legal education, explain the concept of practical reasonableness and show the benefits of its requirements to integrate legal education and limit the use of artificial intelligence in distance learning. Results: The research results consisted of identifying the advantages of practical reasonableness requirements for legal education and the recommendation for the use of artificial intelligence in distance learning in the legal field. Contributions: The requirements of practical reasonableness contribute to the citizen education of law students, which can only be achieved with the participation of human teachers, limiting the use of artificial intelligence in this space to these ethical standards. © 2021, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

AB  - Decision governance in a joint human-machine systems allows application of human creativity alongside complex algorithm and knowledge searches by machines. In a decision making critical situation, this joint venture requires maximum certainty in order to overcome any mission failures. However, current progress in machine intelligence as well as existing research in the artificial intelligence community depends on the best practices and/or standards set forth by individual organizations and government responsible for the advancement of AI or MI. In absence of an expert reference base or knowledge base, more precisely a universal system, we still rely on the information and standards that differ from organization to organization and from government to government. This paper seeks to mitigate this systems gap by looking at a systematic approach in decision governance by developing various levels of ontologies for human-machine systems. In support of this proposed approach, a recent development of top ontology is discussed that revealed the core terminology and their relationships within human-machine systems. This existential understanding even lays the foundation for various other ontological evolution. © American Society for Engineering Management, 2019.

AB  - The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has disrupted established norms and policies, transforming theoretical concepts into remarkable real-world applications. Through the advancement of large language models (LLMs) and deep learning, even non-artists can produce impressive works of art, and chatbots adeptly assist in various tasks. However, the ethical implications of utilizing copyrighted materials in GAI training sets have sparked debates surrounding fair use and the impact on creators. This paper explores the multifaceted ethical landscape of GAI by examining the viewpoints of diverse stakeholders, including copyright owners, artists, and end users. It delves into the consequences of machine learning and training sets on individual rights and innovation, aiming to strike a balance that promotes progress while respecting artistic expression. Moreover, the paper presents a qualitative analysis of prompts submitted to the text-to-image GAI service Midjourney, shedding light on user perspectives. To achieve optimal outcomes, fostering open dialogue between advocates of change and preservation becomes essential. By proactively addressing legal, ethical, and social challenges, society will be better prepared to harness the potential of generative artificial intelligence while safeguarding the rights of creators and nurturing human creativity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Machines are learning fast, and human translators must keep pace by learning with, from and about them. Deep learning (DL) and neural machine translation (NMT) are set to change the reality of translation and the distributions of tasks. Although theoretical and practical courses on computer-aided and/or machine translation abound, less attention has been paid to DL and NMT in most translation programmes. The challenge for translation education is to give students the knowledge and toolkits to learn when and how to embrace the new technologies, and to exploit how and when the added value of human intuition, creativity and ethics can and should be deployed. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and academic essay writing merge to create a transformative intersection in education, each reciprocally refining and reforming the other. AI, through its innovative technologies and flexible learning strategies, elevates academic writing by offering dynamic, interactive learning settings, and personalized educational journeys. This study aimed to explore students' perceptions of AI usage in academic essay writing using a case study design. It involved 245 undergraduate students from 25 tertiary institutions in Eastern and Central Indonesian provinces, with data collected via Google form to gain insights into students' attitudes toward AI tools in writing academic essays. Findings indicated a positive reception of AI-powered writing tools, with students acknowledging their benefits in grammar checks, plagiarism detection, language translation, and essay outlines. AI was found to enhance students' writing abilities, self-efficacy, and understanding of academic integrity. However, some students expressed concerns about potential impacts on creativity, critical thinking, and ethical writing practices. The study emphasized a balanced approach to AI integration, where AI collaborates with human authors, and also identified popular AI tools used by Indonesian students. As such, the research highlighted AI's significant role in supporting academic writing while preserving human creativity and critical thinking, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balanced integration to sustain human ingenuity and critical thought in academic discourse. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - In this chapter, we first lay the foundations identifying Human Centric Artificial Intelligence as linking the ethical requirements to the technical/cognitive dimensions of AI. Based on a sample of 867 AI systems applied to business processes and building on the, Äúthree-dimensional concurrent engineering, Äù framework we provide evidence that Human Centric Artificial Intelligence brings value to business processes, may transform products, and shape business ecosystems. We finally reconcile these two dimensions 1) the level of optimization vs creativity/strategy required by the specific business function, and 2) the level of ethical implications, to identify four main broad types of collaboration between humans and AI Systems. © Margherita Pagani and Renaud Champion 2021.

AB  - The more AI agents are deployed in scenarios with possibly unexpected situations, the more they need to be flexible, adaptive, and creative in achieving the goal we have given them. Thus, a certain level of freedom to choose the best path to the goal is inherent in making AI robust and flexible enough. At the same time, however, the pervasive deployment of AI in our life, whether AI is autonomous or collaborating with humans, raises several ethical challenges. AI agents should be aware and follow appropriate ethical principles and should thus exhibit properties such as fairness or other virtues. These ethical principles should define the boundaries of AI's freedom and creativity. However, it is still a challenge to understand how to specify and reason with ethical boundaries in AI agents and how to combine them appropriately with subjective preferences and goal specifications. Some initial attempts employ either a data-driven example-based approach for both, or a symbolic rule-based approach for both. We envision a modular approach where any AI technique can be used for any of these essential ingredients in decision making or decision support systems, paired with a contextual approach to define their combination and relative weight. In a world where neither humans nor AI systems work in isolation, but are tightly interconnected, e.g., the Internet of Things, we also envision a compositional approach to building ethically bounded AI, where the ethical properties of each component can be fruitfully exploited to derive those of the overall system. In this paper we define and motivate the notion of ethically-bounded AI, we describe two concrete examples, and we outline some outstanding challenges. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - The year 2018 was the moment of increasing awareness of artificial intelligence (AI) in every imaginable domain. This article examines the question have AI technologies and their related hype already affects interaction design practice in the Western industry. It looks at the potential impact in tools, processes and products of interaction design. It highlights three potentially significant themes which stand out of the hype: 1) AI utilization as a technology push 2) generative AI, and 3) the ethics of AI. Each theme is analyzed to derive the claim that for now, AI has little specific impact on interaction design. On a closer observation, generative AI is one the themes that promises the biggest change in the longer run but is simultaneously an elusive hope, which may never lead to anything but AI-augmented creativity support tools, some of which already exist. The article describes the AI hype is partially positive, partially problematic for the advancement of design goals. The hype contributes positively by helping to surface healthy ethical debates that give more credence to designers’ long-term attempts to be user-centered and ethical. This ethical discussion tends to neglect the fact that the ethical burden bestowed upon algorithms is not a new one but was going on long before the big data fuzz. It is evidently now more critical than ever. This articles’ intention is to inform the academic researchers working on human-computer interaction and interaction design about the need to continue developing human-centered AI for both general audiences and specifically for interaction designers. There are already promising examples of HCI research that show potential to affect design practice. Common to all is that they do not attempt to roll out a full generative AI solution but rather support human designers in iterative and somewhat well-constrained tasks. Overall it seems that by 2020, interaction designers will be increasingly working on technology that involves AI elements, but those elements itself will not yet be core of how their work is carried out. Awareness of the ethical challenges and technical affordances related to AI technology and its utilization will become more important than the integration of AI into the interaction design process in the short term. By the end of 2020’s, we maybe yet looking into a very different reality from now. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Creativity is associated with finding novel, surprising, and useful solutions. We argue that creative cognitive processes, divergent thinking, abstraction, and improvisation are constructed on different novelty-based processes. The prefrontal cortex plays a role in creative ideation by providing a control mechanism. Moreover, thinking about novel solutions activates the distant or loosely connected neurons of a semantic network that involves the hippocampus. Novelty can also be interpreted as different combinations of earlier learned processes, such as the motor sequencing mechanism of the basal ganglia. In addition, the cerebellum is responsible for the precise control of movements, which is particularly important in improvisation. Our neurocomputational perspective is based on three creative processes centered on novelty seeking, subserved by the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and dopamine. The algorithmic implementation of our model would enable us to describe commonalities and differences between these creative processes based on the proposed neural circuitry. Given that most previous studies have mainly provided theoretical and conceptual models of creativity, this article presents the first brain-inspired neural network model of creative cognition. © 2022

AB  - There are numerous fresh ways of thinking and creativity as a result of the ongoing development of art design. How do you create a fantastic logo that has extraordinary artistic effects? The incorrect interpretation of artistic graphics can cause a special visual phenomenon known as the contradiction between visual images and objective reality, which causes people's visual systems to produce points of interest. Wrong vision graphics, or visual paradox, can give people a wonderful experience that transcends time and space and reveals the enigmatic beauty that is concealed in the natural order, which is in line with the design goals of sign art. The integration of design and artificial intelligence has drawn a lot of attention as science and technology have advanced. Designing an intelligent and comfortable user experience is more important than ever, especially given the world's growing digital demand. The technical limitations of algorithm black boxes exacerbate the power disparity between humans and algorithms, which is inherent in artificial algorithms. According to its research, artificial intelligence's algorithm is responsible for roughly 60% of its calculations. Random forest technology's current benefits and drawbacks are contrasted with those of popular algorithms, and a clear vision of its potential applications in the future is presented. The artificial algorithm's recommended operation mechanism chooses the algorithm's nontechnical neutrality and value orientation.  © 2022 Hexin Zheng.

AB  - A design technique for intangible cultural creative products based on pharma industries ethics education among educator's generation is suggested to address the issue of low image fusion caused by the high cost of clustering calculation in the design of such items. The intangible cultural heritage image is extracted and segmented. The image is divided into different regions according to the gray level of pixels, and the edge detection algorithm of images in different regions of the product is designed to make the region near the picture more fit. The fusion image of intangible cultural heritage features is generated based on pharma industries' ethical education with educators, so as to reduce the cost of clustering calculation and complete the splicing of artistic style. Build the design model of intangible cultural creative products, combine the design creativity, and realize the mutual integration of intangible culture and products. Construct four image sample sets of scenic spots and historic sites, religious beliefs, festival folk customs, and handmade, and test the fusion degree. Taking the festival folk custom image set as an example, the average fusion degree of this method is 0.773, which is 0.133 and 0.145 higher than the comparison method based on convolutional neural network and machine learning, respectively. Therefore, it has a good application effect. © 2022 ThinkBiotech LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the intersection of machine learning and dance has garnered increasing attention as a means to enhance the aesthetics and creativity of dance performance. Machine learning techniques, such as human-pose detection, have been utilized to analyze body movement and generate visual models in realtime, offering new approaches to traditional art form. However, despite the growing interest in this field, there is a lack of comprehensive research that evaluates the impact of machine learning on dance from multiple perspectives. This systematic review addresses this gap by examining the impact of machine learning on four key aspects of dance performance: choreographic creation support; dataset or network collection and training; improved techniques of human-pose detection; perception and new visual representations of dance movement. This exploration reveals that machine learning contributes both positively and negatively to artistic development, introducing a sense of novelty and heightened interest in the performance while concurrently prompting ethical concerns regarding artistic ownership and authorship. Through a nuanced analysis of machine learning's effects on key aspects of dance, this study aims to provide valuable insights into how these technologies can enhance the artistic practice in dance while signaling areas that demand further research in this rapidly evolving field. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - ChatGPT, an extensively recognised language model created by OpenAI, has gained significant prominence across various industries, particularly in education. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence students' intentions to adopt and utilise ChatGPT for their academic studies. The study used a Structural Equation Model (SEM) for analysing the data gathered from 108 participants, comprising both undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in public and private universities in Vietnam. The findings indicated that students' inclination to adopt ChatGPT (referred to as adoption intention or AI) was influenced by their perception of its user-friendliness (PEU). However, the perceived usefulness (PU) of ChatGPT did not have a direct impact on students' adoption intention; instead, it had an indirect influence through personalisation (with a positive effect) and interactivity (with a negative effect). Importantly, there was no significant indirect effect of PU on AI mediated by perceived trust and perceived intelligence. This study is one of the initial empirical inquiries into ChatGPT adoption within an Asian context, providing valuable insights in this emerging area of research. As the use of ChatGPT by students becomes increasingly inevitable, educational institutions should carefully consider integrating it into the assessment process. It is crucial to design assessments that encourage responsible usage of ChatGPT, preserving students' critical thinking abilities and creativity in their assessment writing. Moving forward, educators will play a pivotal role by offering clear guidelines and instructions that set out the appropriate and ethical use of artificial intelligence tools in the assessments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The goal here is to identify key directions for the future advanced research initiatives in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and beyond. The following areas are identified as having particular importance: (1) socially emotional, ethical, and moral AI, (2) self-developing and self-sustainable AI, and (3) human-analogous AI, inspired by the human psychology. As a result, a general concept is formulated with the intent to clarify and unify the currently popular slogans, including Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Strong AI, Human-Level or Humanlike AI (HLAI), Brain-Inspired or Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA), and more. The key idea of the proposed concept is that future AI must open a new angle of view and new perspectives to humans, thereby enriching and transforming the society, helping it to solve its problems and taking the civilization to a new level. While being created by humans, for humans, and fully compatible with humans at the social level, it will not be "a human in silicon", but rather an "alien": Intelligent, friendly, and welcome. Its principles will combine preprogrammed basic functions and its own natural ontogeny in a virtual social environment. Forms of implementation will range from virtual entities to wearable electronics and autonomous robots. The expected impact on the society will be immense and crucial for its survival. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Convolutional and adversarial networks are found in various fields of knowledge and activities. One such field is building design, a multi-disciplinary and multi-task process involving many different requirements and preferences. Although showing several advantages over traditional computational methods, they are still far from being part of the daily design practice. Nevertheless, if fully integrated, these methods are expected to accelerate design and automate procedures. This paper reviews these methods’ latest advances and applications to identify current barriers and suggests future developments. For that, a systematic literature review extended with forward and backward snowball methods was carried out. The focus was on the first design phases, including site layout, floor planning, furniture arrangement, and facade design. The network models show great potential in exploring novel design paths, comparing alternative solutions, and reducing task-associated time and cost. In addition, newer approaches may benefit from combining convolutional and adversarial networks in decision-making since they may complement analysis and synthesis. However, the lack of a smooth integration into the design process and the need for a high-level mastery limit their widespread use. Furthermore, ethical issues arise, such as models being trained with biased datasets, ignoring the intellectual property of the data creators, potential violation of privacy, and the models limiting human creativity. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This article examines the intricate relationship between humans and text-to-image generative models (generative artificial intelligence/genAI) in the realm of art. The article frames that relationship in the theory of mediated actiona well-established theory that conceptualizes how tools shape human thoughts and actions. The article describes genAI systems as learning, cocreating, and communicating, multimodally capable hybrid systems that distill and rely on the wisdom and creativity of massive crowds of people and can sometimes surpass them. Those systems elude the theoretical description of the role of tools and locus of control in mediated action. The article asks how well the theory can accommodate both the transformative potential of genAI tools in creative fields and art, and the ethics of the emergent social dynamics it generates. The article concludes by discussing the fundamental changes and broader implications that genAI brings to the realm of mediated action and, ultimately, to the very fabric of our daily lives.  © 1981-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Currently there are very few AI tools available to conference reviewers to support the academic process. In this paper we present a naive, first attempt at an automated conference reviewer called pReview. pReview provides a paper summary, contribution summary, writing quality analysis, and set of potential related works as well as an intellectual space visualization to aid the busy academics who volunteer their time as conference paper reviewers. To limit the plethora of ethical issues emerging when a computer is left to judge a human creation, pReview and future systems of this variety should be judiciously viewed as review support tools and never as a replacement for the traditional review process. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This position piece starts to examine the ways in which AI-based autonomous technologies have begun to influence a range of human activities in the arts and creative industries.The rise of AI-generated art could potentially transform the act of creation and impact our understandings of creativity - from painting, writing, and music composition, to video animation. At the same time, there is increasing debate about the social, ethical, and legal implications of using these tools (eg copyright, biased data sets, devaluing artistic processes). Responsible Innovation (RI) could have a crucial role to play in understanding and responding to the complexity of debates. We will explore and unpack how artists, AI developers and associated audiences/consumers of art have started to approach some of these issues. We will use these ideas as a starting point to explicate and further develop discourses surrounding the challenges associated with these technologies in the context of the creative industries. Finally, we will investigate how and if these challenges might be addressed.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - The judgment of the German Federal Patent Court (Bundespatentgericht) in the Food container case1 holds a unique place in the worldwide series of DABUS2 cases. On the one hand, it confirmed that an artificial intelligence (AI) system cannot be regarded as an inventor under patent law, which has so far been a dominant trend in other jurisdictions concerned with the matter.3 On the other hand, it allowed the applicant Stephen Thaler, who insisted on not having invented the food container, to be designated as the inventor in the patent application, thus, opening up an opportunity for him to become the patent owner. While the case outcome may appear as a constructive compromise, one may question the internal consistency of the court's reasoning. This analysis shows that the judgment is paradoxical in that, by allowing Thaler to be deemed the inventor of the food container, it contradicts the very principle of human creativity underlying the inventor's (moral) right to be named - the principle that was relied upon by the adjudicating Board when denying the designation of DABUS as the inventor.  © 2022 Published by OUP and CH Beck on behalf of GRUR e.V.

AB  - This book includes contributions by scholars from a variety of disciplines, the dialogue and discourse on how AI (artificial intelligence) development includes and/or excludes pedagogical educational learning theories focused on the learner. A call from Educational Leaders Without Borders (ELWB) was issued to scholars from across the globe who were asked to write a vignette described as an evocative description or account on how education leaders envision education in 2051 and A.I. beyond mere product purchase. These vignettes should engage us in questions as to how the development and use of AI technologies are shaped. As educators who believe education should be established on social justice beliefs and practices, our review of literature shows there are no books addressing the complexities of A.I. development and the role of educators. The futuristic element is unique in its approach to imagine a socially just better world in which to inspire educators. This unique feature encourages creativity in how one addresses the call to imagine a future world and our role as educators in that world. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human-created systems are becoming ever more powerful and increasingly include the potential to harm large numbers of people, threaten their livelihood, and ultimately the survival of the human race. The vision of machines as mere tools of humans is increasingly being eclipsed by machines of such complexity that the human mental capacity no longer suffices to control a system. If humans are to stay in control of the systems they create, they need to make use of the cognitive capabilities of the very systems they are endeavoring to control. This requires an effective integration of the human and the machine. We use the paradigm of a purposeful system to re-examine the role of human insight and creativity in a system to resolve interdependence of purpose and system boundary. Since the system is a process, the human role spans the entire system life-cycle. A number of examples are used to show how humans are properly integrated into the system and how their control over the system can be assured. The systems considered range from ones of limited scope, and including mostly physical machines, all the way to systems of potentially global impacts in which the “machines” are mostly non-physical mechanisms, including algorithms and legal and ethical frameworks. The examples confirm that the threat to human control over machines is very real and that urgent action is required to reverse the threat – if it is not already too late. We show that, through hierarchies of purposeful systems, it may be possible to design system architectures that can assure that humans stay in control. At times, this may require that, under certain circumstances, some humans, for a limited time, submit to the authority of the “machine.”. © 2017 ISCA.

AB  - This paper explores the application of chat-based Generative AI (GenAI) in the Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN) authoring process, advocating for a human-centered approach rooted in a Digital Humanist perspective. It scrutinizes GenAI’s capacity to augment human narrative creation and unveils the complexities inherent in its integration into IDN authoring. The potential risks tied to GenAI’s incorporation, including data exploitation, displacement of human labor, and the potential diminishment of human agency and creativity, are thoroughly examined. Offering a precautionary viewpoint, this work outlines Digital Humanist principles to guide GenAI’s use in authoring, which includes elevating organic creativity and human agency. Further, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability, the author underscores the importance of maintaining a harmonious, human-led creation process to serve the social good. The aim is to center the human elements of authoring while ethically leveraging GenAI’s capabilities, paving the way for a future where IDNs embody collective human values and uphold creative integrity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Over the past few years, specialised online and offline press blossomed with articles about art made “with" Artificial Intelligence (AI) but the narrative is rapidly changing. In fact, in October 2018, the auction house Christie's sold an art piece allegedly made “by" an AI. We draw from philosophy of art and science arguing that AI as a technical object is always intertwined with human nature despite its level of autonomy. However, the use of creative autonomous agents has cultural and social implications in the way we experience art as creators as well as audience. Therefore, we highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary dialogue by promoting a culture of transparency of the technology used, awareness of the meaning of technology in our society and the value of creativity in our lives. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Generative AI tools have emerged as transformative resources in the realm of communication education. These tools harness the power of artificial intelligence to assist students and educators in various aspects of communication studies, including writing, public speaking, and media production. At their core, generative AI tools are designed to generate human-like text, speech, or visuals autonomously, replicating and augmenting the capabilities of human communication. They encompass a range of applications, from chatbots that facilitate communication skill development to language models that assist in content creation and editing. These tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in communication classrooms, providing unique opportunities for personalized learning, skill enhancement, and creativity. © 2024, IGI Global.

AB  - Generative AI is disrupting the creative process(es) of intellectual works on an unparalleled scale. Algorithmic tools are increasing users’ production capacity for literary and artistic works to almost infinite levels. However, the quality of the outputs is strictly dependent on the quantity and quality of the inputs, some of which are protected by copyright. This scenario gave raise to tensions between copyright holders and generative AI companies. While the formers claim control over this new kind of exploitation of their works, the latters wish to train their algorithms freely with as many contents as possible. This contribution suggests exploring the idea of introducing a statutory license for machine learning purposes as a compromise solution to ensure an attractive environment for artificial intelligence without marginalizing the role played by human authors. This remuneration proposal is rooted in a fundamental rights analysis that balances i.e., the right to science and culture and freedom of artistic expression (Arts. 11 and 13 EUCF, 19 UDHR, 27.1 UDHR, 15.1 a and b ICESCR) vis-à-vis the right for creators to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from their scientific, literary or artistic production (Arts. 17.2 EUCF, 27.2 UDHR, and 15.1 c ICESCR). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An analysis of the behavior of Internet users from the point of view of their preferences in the choice of information sources and the effectiveness of their impact is presented. It is shown that the modern infocommunication space has undergone qualitative changes in the most recent time, and these transformations are already having a pronounced impact on higher education, mainly through the factor of competition between information sources. It is shown that these transformations can be interpreted as the evolution of the noosphere, which is considered as a global infocommunication network, in which non-Trivial transpersonal information objects are formed. Their existence leads to the fact that the human intellect has a dual nature-both individual and collective principles are present in it at the same time. The latter is responsible for such phenomena as the collective unconscious, understood in the sense of Jung. It is shown that the neural network model of the noosphere makes it possible to formulate a similar concept of "professional collective unconscious", which is responsible for professional intuition, acts of creativity, etc. In turn, the existence of the professional collective unconscious forces us to radically reconsider the content of what is called training and move to the concept of meta-learning, which, among other things, involves stimulating transitions from one level of interaction with transpersonal information structures that make up the professional collective unconscious to another.  © Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Today, teaching and learning paths increasingly intersect with technologies powered by emerging artificial intelligence (AI).This work analyses public opinions and sentiments about AI applications that affect e-learning, such as ChatGPT, virtual and augmented reality, microlearning, mobile learning, adaptive learning, and gamification. The way people perceive technologies fuelled by artificial intelligence can be tracked in real time in microblog messages promptly shared by Twitter users, who currently constitute a large and ever-increasing number of individuals. The observation period was from November 30, 2022, the date on which ChatGPT was launched, to March 31, 2023. A two-step sentiment analysis was performed on the collected English-language tweets to determine the overall sentiments and emotions. A latent Dirichlet allocation model was built to identify commonly discussed topics in tweets. The results show that the majority of opinions are positive. Among the eight emotions of the Syuzhet package, ‘trust’ and ‘joy’ are the most common positive emotions observed in the tweets, while ‘fear’ is the most common negative emotion. Among the most discussed topics with a negative outlook, two particular aspects of fear are identified: an ‘apocalyptic-fear’ that artificial intelligence could lead the end of humankind, and a fear for the ‘future of artistic and intellectual jobs’ as AI could not only destroy human art and creativity but also make the individual contributions of students and researchers not assessable. On the other hand, among the topics with a positive outlook, trust and hope in AI tools for improving efficiency in jobs and the educational world are identified. Overall, the results suggest that AI will play a significant role in the future of the world and education, but it is important to consider the potential ethical and social implications of this technology. By leveraging the positive aspects of AI while addressing these concerns, the education system can unlock the full potential of this emerging technology and provide a better learning experience for students. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The emergence of complex deep-learning models capable of producing novel images on a practically innumerable number of subjects and in an equally wide variety of artistic styles is beginning to highlight serious inadequacies in the ethical, aesthetic, epistemological and legal frameworks we have so far used to categorise art. To begin tackling these issues and identifying a role for AI in the production and protection of human artwork, it is necessary to take a multidisciplinary approach which considers current legal precedents, the practice of software engineering, historical attitudes towards technological innovation and a sustained technical analysis of the models themselves. This paper queries the location and nature of substantive artistic work in the developmental stages of an AI-generated image, offering critiques of existing assumptions and posing questions for future research. The emergence of convincing AI creative output, artistic or literary, has significant long-term implications for the humanities, including the need for re-appraisal of foundational ideas about authorship and creativity in general. The effects of artificial intelligence, whether generalised or task-specific, cannot be ignored or displaced now that easy-access, scalable image and text production is a reality. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Massive inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the technosphere and electronic governments urges an update in legal regulation of these and related areas. The issue converges on the key question of whether AI can be endowed with legal personhood and capacity. Opposing views in this respect build on hardly compatible ethics and largely outdated scientific grounds with a clear perspective for deep cultural antagonisms and further fragmentation of the world. We contribute to this debate from the perspective of quantum cognitive science and show how it can resolve some of the current impasses. Our approach builds on the quantum-theoretic refinement of the concept of uncertainty into quantum and classical types: classical uncertainty denotes subjective ignorance of the present state of affairs, while quantum uncertainty accounts for individual freedom to construct the future. We show that legal capacity of intelligence, at bottom, is defined by the type of uncertainty it is capable to resolve. Natural intelligence, in particular, can resolve quantum uncertainties, generating genuine novelty and affective experience in the process. Classical AI, in contrast, is limited to algorithmic computation, bound to produce predefined results regardless of its complexity. Concepts of decision-making, subjectness, creativity, and personal meaning then are recognized as physically inapplicable to such systems. The proposed definitions of these terms complement and sharpen the criteria of legal capacity in the existing legislations, indicating that “autonomy” is essentially equivalent to “appreciation.” Classical AI then appears as fundamentally alien to subjectness and legal capacity both in civil and common laws, resolving a delicate contradiction between them. Quantum-empowered AI, in contrast, escapes this conclusion due to its access to quantum uncertainty, introducing novel challenges with respect to responsibility gaps and meaningful human control. The developed approach aligns with the present legal practice and ethical discourse, contributing to the scientifically informed development of law in technological societies. © 2023, University of Tyumen.

AB  - According to Brooks [2017. “The Big Problem with Self-driving Cars Is People”. IEEE Spectrum: Technology, Engineering, and Science News], artificial intelligence has had a variable track-record of usefulness in situations where context and environmental knowledge are responsible for shaping human interactions. In 2021, providing contextually aware training to supervised machine learning is still a non-trivial task for AI models that involve complex systems. In addition, knowledge held only across distributed members of a community, within culture, or tacitly within the wider environment of the ambient commons [McCullough 2013. Ambient Commons: Attention in the Age of Embodied Information. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] evades consistent generalizable modelling–even in technical domains such as traffic flow management, atmospheric chemistry, or the prediction of election results. Yet it is precisely these interactions of context, community, culture and environment that also define how music can be created. The creative arts can themselves be thought of as a complex system. Assuming that creativity is non-generalizable, this paper assesses creative processes through a humanities-centric lens of machine learning and robotics, aiming to better understand relationships between context, environment and experimental system in artistic research. These relationships are now themselves significantly digitally mediated, requiring a change in academic discourse away from artefacts which need discrete research justification towards a more holistic, and often non-linear view of networks that require cultural situation. In doing so, issues of creative accountability [Field 2021. “Changing the Vocabulary of Creative Research: The Role of Networks, Risk, and Accountability in Transcending Technical Rationality.” In Sound Work: Composition as Critical Technical Practice, edited by J. Impett, 303–317.Orpheus Institute Series. Leuven: Leuven University Press] and the implications of substituting “creative question” for “research question” are examined within creative research. Early twentieth century ideas related to progressivism which have instrumentalized creative practice, particularly where technology forms part of art making, are challenged by re-thinking change through new models. The Three Horizons change model [Sharpe 2016. “Three Horizons: A Pathways Practice for Transformation.” Ecology and Society 21 (2): 47] originally intended to describe environmental ecosystems, is assessed as a practical tool for designing creative research. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Cognitive neuroenhancement (CNE) involves the use of medical interventions to improve normal cognitive functioning such as memory, focus, concentration, or willpower. In this paper I give a Kantian argument defending the use of CNE in science, scholarly research, and creative fields. Kant’s universal law formulation of the categorical imperative shows why enhancement is morally wrong in the familiar contexts of sports or competitive games. This argument, however, does not apply to the use of CNE in higher education, scholarly or scientific research, or creative endeavors such as visual art, fiction or poetry, or musical composition. This is because performance in these areas is embedded within practices that differ in morally significant ways from competitive practices. This important difference provides good reason to think that there is nothing morally wrong with the use of CNE in these areas. My approach is not simply to assume a full-fledged Kantian ethical theory and apply it straight away to the enhancement issue but to establish a reflective equilibrium between our moral intuitions, (Kantian) moral principles that support those intuitions, and the nature of the practices involved. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Is it possible to construct an artificial person? Researchers in the field of artificial intelligence have for decades been developing computer programs that emulate human intelligence. This book goes beyond intelligence and describes how close we are to recreating many of the other capacities that make us human. These abilities include learning, creativity, consciousness, and emotion.; The attempt to understand and engineer these abilities constitutes the new interdisciplinary field of artificial psychology, which is characterized by contributions from philosophy, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and robotics, This work is intended for use as a main or supplementary introductory textbook for a course in cognitive psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, or the philosophy of mind. it examines human abilities as operating requirements that an artificial person must have and analyzes them from a multidisciplinary approach.; The book is comprehensive in scope, covering traditional topics like perception, memory, and problem solving. However, it also describes recent advances in the study of free will, ethical behavior, affective architectures, social robots, and hybrid human-machine societies. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Social robots are being designed to help support people’s well-being in domestic and public environments. To address increasing incidences of psychological and emotional difficulties such as loneliness, and a shortage of human healthcare workers, we believe that robots will also play a useful role in engaging with people in therapy, on an emotional and creative level, e.g., in music, drama, playing, and art therapy. Here, we focus on the latter case, on an autonomous robot capable of painting with a person. A challenge is that the theoretical foundations are highly complex; we are only just beginning ourselves to understand emotions and creativity in human science, which have been described as highly important challenges in artificial intelligence. To gain insight, we review some of the literature on robots used for therapy and art, potential strategies for interacting, and mechanisms for expressing emotions and creativity. In doing so, we also suggest the usefulness of the responsive art approach as a starting point for art therapy robots, describe a perceived gap between our understanding of emotions in human science and what is currently typically being addressed in engineering studies, and identify some potential ethical pitfalls and solutions for avoiding them. Based on our arguments, we propose a design for an art therapy robot, also discussing a simplified prototype implementation, toward informing future work in the area. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The intense deployment of computers and artificial intelligence in modern society encourages the renewal of the psychiatric clinic, but also warns against the risks of such an orientation. The clinician is then encouraged to change his perspective in order to consider the internal dynamics of mental disorders. The functionalities of a computer system integrating a great deal of knowledge also make it possible to better understand the gradual discrepancy of the experience which is established by its submission to the grip of digital. Sociocultural disruptions can thus arise, making the patient and the observer dependent on the computer system, thereby complicating the analysis and treatment of mental disorders. Safeguard measures are therefore to be considered. Awareness of these risks is already essential; it recalls the technical and psychological disadvantages that can alter the freedom, the creativity and the ethics of the person. On the other hand, given the architectonics of natural and artificial systems, the organizational strength of the natural system and its orientation have a crucial role and imply the need for their reactivation. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - This work was developed to implement and apply a theatre playwriting technique for an art-based research in the domain of social sustainability of artificial intelligence and robotization. The use of artistic media, instead of the prevalent technical and normative approaches to sustainability, allows to develop a reflective aesthetic enquiry, supporting a “learning by heart”, that should parallel analytical thinking. First, some key methodological elements to be applied to the playwriting process were defined. In particular, the process of interactive meaning-making among researchers, the multisensory knowing as forms of expression of the self and creativity and the experience of action. Moreover, the integration scientific knowledge, the communication of complexity and the focus of feelings, as element of authenticity, were considered. The methodological elements were integrated into the writing process of “The Wizard of RobOz”, inspired by Baum's novel, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. The play focused on human identity, in contrast to robot identity. Feelings (altruism and love) emerged as the core of good choices. The contrast between human and non-human agents, was, then, resolved considering the importance of design in obtaining a good integration between the two worlds. The topic of the play is relevant at societal level, due to the foreseen transition to a “society 5.0”, where humans and non-human agents will have to be integrated. The evaluation phase showed that a coherent and structure story was generated though the fixed technique. However, the perceived authenticity and resonance evaluation should be implemented with further work. The focus on social sustainability of robotization and AI constituted a novelty with respect to previous works, which only investigated the technological application of robots to theatre. the use of a scientific literature review to support the brainstorming phase served to implement the integration between science and art. Another element of innovation was the use of professional performers, instead than scientists. In parallel, this play allowed to apply an open source robot design, building and programming for theatrical purpose. The large participation of public to the representation showed the potentiality to transfer this playwriting technique into the domains of new education and communication projects. However, it would be recommended to integrate, within the research and meaning-making process, the other dimensions of sustainability, as well as a relevant presence of ethical reasoning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper highlights the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and text-generating models such as ChatGPT (GPT-Generative Pretrained Transformer) on Ukrainian education. It has been found that the introduction of this tool is both beneficial and problematic. On the one hand, it saves time for the information search, facilitates the research process for both teachers and students through proposing ideas, and creates education-related content that emulates human writing. On the other hand, ChatGPT sometimes outputs biased or unverified information that causes misunderstanding among the participants in the educational process. Moreover, in the case of inappropriate application, this tool limits the creativity of the students and decreases their critical thinking skills. The research is based on a survey (Google Forms) distributed through Facebook groups and university networks all over Ukraine. 1035 educational and pedagogical practitioners and teachers took part in the study. The results obtained from the respondents indicate that there are opportunities for the successful implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process. A significant majority of 83.6% of the respondents confirmed that the impact of AI depends on its usage. The survey also highlights various areas for ChatGPT improvements, such as “understanding context,” “giving more accurate answers,” “improving visual capability,” etc. However, it is inevitable to understand that combining human intellectual capability and ChatGPT potential goes beyond the boundaries of human possibilities, speeds up the process of innovative idea generation, and enables the educational process to be more meaningful and effective. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought opportunities and challenges to human society. It promotes the progress of society and the development of science and technology, and also increases the unemployment rate and the ethical dilemma of technology. The weakness of artificial intelligence lies in the lack of creativity. If human beings want to have core competitiveness in the era of artificial intelligence, they must change education and enhance creativity. Education reform should be carried out from three aspects: one is to cultivate scientific and technological literacy; two is to cultivate data literacy; three is to cultivate humanistic quality. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - This paper critically examines the ethical issues of current and predicted adoption of AI within fashion. AI is a branch of computer science that combines machine learning, logic and natural language processing to emulate human intelligence. By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.

AB  - The platform economy, the move towards artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing importance of new creative and transformative technologies such as 3D printing raise questions as to whether copyright law suffices in its present form. Our article argues that copyright law is malleable enough to fulfil some of its traditional functions in this new technology-aided (and technology-dominated) environment. However, certain adjustments and complementary instruments seem to be necessary to revitalise these functions. For example, moral rights could be more effectively harmonised at international level, and made more easily enforceable, to reflect the global reach of social media and to protect their essential reputational value in a digital economy that prioritises online exposure over remuneration opportunities. We also consider that creators’ rights are difficult, if not impossible, to license and enforce in an environment where contractual practices such as social media terms and conditions impose standard agreements that either do not compensate creators at all or compensate them only marginally. In this context, restoring the bargaining power of creators through the right of access to the platforms’ data seems to have become as important as copyright itself. Finally, doubts remain as to whether requirements such as authorship and originality can continue to apply and trigger copyright protection. To this end, we believe that the distinction between fully generative machines and other technologies that merely assist human creators is essential for the proper identification of “authorless” works. For such works we advocate the adoption of a very short right that would support computational creativity without stifling human ingenuity. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - We call for a paradigm shift in engineering education. We are entering the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (“4IR”), accelerated by Artificial Intelligence (“AI”). Disruptive changes affect all industrial sectors and society, leading to increased uncertainty that makes it impossible to predict what lies ahead. Therefore, gradual cultural change in education is no longer an option to ease social pain. The vast majority of engineering education and training systems, which have remained largely static and underinvested for decades, are inadequate for the emerging 4IR and AI labour markets. Nevertheless, some positive developments can be observed in the reorientation of the engineering education sector. Novel approaches to engineering education are already providing distinctive, technology-enhanced, personalised, student-centred curriculum experiences within an integrated and unified education system. We need to educate engineering students for a future whose key characteristics are volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (“VUCA”). Talent and skills gaps are expected to increase in all industries in the coming years. The authors argue for an engineering curriculum that combines timeless didactic traditions such as Socratic inquiry, mastery-based and project-based learning and first-principles thinking with novel elements, e.g., student-centred active and e-learning with a focus on case studies, as well as visualization/metaverse and gamification elements discussed in this paper, and a refocusing of engineering skills and knowledge enhanced by AI on human qualities such as creativity, empathy and dexterity. These skills strengthen engineering students’ perceptions of the world and the decisions they make as a result. This 4IR engineering curriculum will prepare engineering students to become curious engineers and excellent collaborators who navigate increasingly complex multistakeholder ecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Surgeons perform two primary tasks: operating and engaging patients and caregivers in shared decision-making. Human dexterity and decision-making are biologically limited. Intelligent, autonomous machines have the potential to augment or replace surgeons. Rather than regarding this possibility with denial, ire, or indifference, surgeons should understand and steer these technologies. Closer examination of surgical innovations and lessons learned from the automotive industry can inform this process. Innovations in minimally invasive surgery and surgical decision-making follow classic S-shaped curves with three phases: (1) introduction of a new technology, (2) achievement of a performance advantage relative to existing standards, and (3) arrival at a performance plateau, followed by replacement with an innovation featuring greater machine autonomy and less human influence. There is currently no level I evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes using intelligent, autonomous machines for performing operations or surgical decision-making tasks. History suggests that if such evidence emerges and if the machines are cost effective, then they will augment or replace humans, initially for simple, common, rote tasks under close human supervision and later for complex tasks with minimal human supervision. This process poses ethical challenges in assigning liability for errors, matching decisions to patient values, and displacing human workers, but may allow surgeons to spend less time gathering and analyzing data and more time interacting with patients and tending to urgent, critical—and potentially more valuable—aspects of patient care.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has a rich history in literature; fiction has shaped how we view artificial agents and their capacities in the real world. This paper looks at embodied examples of human-machine co-creation from the literature of the Long 18th Century (1,650–1,850), examining how older depictions of creative machines could inform and inspire modern day research. The works are analyzed from the perspective of design fiction with special focus on the embodiment of the systems and the creativity exhibited by them. We find that the chosen examples highlight the importance of recognizing the environment as a major factor in human-machine co-creative processes and that some of the works seem to precede current examples of artificial systems reaching into our everyday lives. The examples present embodied interaction in a positive, creativity-oriented way, but also highlight ethical risks of human-machine co-creativity. Modern day perceptions of artificial systems and creativity can be limited to some extent by the technologies available; fictitious examples from centuries past allow us to examine such limitations using a Design Fiction approach. We conclude by deriving four guidelines for future research from our fictional examples: 1) explore unlikely embodiments; 2) think of situations, not systems; 3) be aware of the disjunction between action and appearance; and 4) consider the system as a situated moral agent. © Copyright © 2021 Kantosalo, Falk and Jordanous.

AB  - Human attitudes of objection, protest, and rebellion have undeniable potential to bring about social benefits, from social justice to healthy balance in relationships. At times, they can even be argued to be ethically obligatory. Conversely, AI rebellion is largely seen as a dangerous, destructive prospect. With the increase of interest in collaborative human/AI environments in which synthetic agents play social roles or, at least, exhibit behavior with social and ethical implications, we believe that AI rebellion could have benefits similar to those of its counterpart in humans. We introduce a framework meant to help categorize and design Rebel Agents, discuss their social and ethical implications, and assess their potential benefits and the risks they may pose. We also present AI rebellion scenarios in two considerably different contexts (military unmanned vehicles and computational social creativity) that exemplify components of the framework. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - The paper has a review character, and the presented analysis is based on theoretical considerations referring to the works of other authors. The aim of the paper is to draw attention to the importance of human creativity in the context of technology development, with special emphasis on artificial intelligence. For the purpose of exploration, the study applies philosophical methods, especially methods typical of ethical reflections, also supported by the analysis of existing data derived from social sciences, especially contemporary sociology. The study is synthetic in nature and includes theoretical considerations concerning several issues. Positive and creative possibilities of using artificial intelligence in social and economic life were shown. Potential threats that may be associated with the inappropriate use of artificial intelligence – robots and information systems were also identified. Potential threats resulting from too much trust of people in algorithms were shown. Attention is focused on social and ethical aspects of the human-machine relationship, with special emphasis on the dimension of pragmatism, trust and fascination with new technologies, as well as the principles of robot ethics. A significant part of the considerations also refers to the effects of automation processes, including the functioning of the labour market, human creative abilities and appropriate competences. The third part of the study indicates still undeveloped research fields related to artificial intelligence. The conducted analysis may indicate the direction for further sociological and philosophical research that considers the specificity of the artificial intelligence functioning and seeks support in interdisciplinary research teams. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Common Model of Cognition (CMC) is a collective attempt to develop a consensus on cognitive architectures. The model needs to be extended to include components and functions that are vital to achieving the goals of Humanlike AI, supporting humanlike learnability, social acceptability and humanlike creativity. Being biologically grounded, together these components will enable social-emotional character reasoning in artifacts and support emotionally-driven behavior generation. Historically, cognitive architectures originated from rule-based systems. Their main building block then evolved to a variety of structures, collectively called here schemas. While a schema is an overloaded term, in the field of biologically inspired cognitive architectures (BICA) it can be given a precise and useful meaning, allowing comparison of different models. Here one particular model is used as the main example: emotional BICA, or eBICA (Samsonovich, BICA, 2013) that extends GMU BICA (Samsonovich & De Jong, 2005) and supports human-like socially-emotional intelligence. This becomes possible with the help of so-called moral schemas. Their operation relies on semantic maps and contributes to the functioning of narrative networks. The present work documents the general formalism of schemas of eBICA, defines moral schemas, and explains their usage on examples. This framework is expected to enable a human-level believability and social compatibility in virtual actors and cobots across a variety of practically important domains and paradigms, thereby contributing to the expected breakthrough in humane artificial intelligence. Expected applications include virtual cobots-assistants and actors-partners in a broad spectrum of tasks. Forming a consensus on goals, paradigms, metrics and target applications for the new framework is equally important in understanding the overarching mission of solving the BICA Challenge. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite the world becoming more interconnected than ever before, inequality and poverty continue to pose a threat to sustainable development. In response to these challenges, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) promotes Global Citizenship Education (GCED), which aims to instill values, attitudes, and behaviors in people so that they may consider the importance of responsible global citizenship – a concept that entails creativity, innovation, and dedication to peace, human rights, and sustainable development, among others. The GCED program raises the awareness of students of all ages to recognize that these issues are global in nature rather than localized and encourage them to participate actively in contributing to a peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, safe, and sustainable society. This research demonstrates how a user-friendly, low-code, human-centric probabilistic strategy can be utilized to democratize artificial intelligence (AI) usage, thus allowing analysts who are not computer scientists to use AI for social good. This reasoning approach can be useful in the predictive modeling of social issues that GCED is concerned with, which are demonstrated by the examples: (1) promoting global sustainable development, (2) alleviating malnutrition, (3) increasing financial inclusion for people who are underserved by traditional banking institutions, and (4) strengthening food security resilience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Digital technologies and data science have laid down the promise to revolutionize healthcare by transforming the way health and disease are analyzed and managed in the future. Digital health applications in healthcare include telemedicine, electronic health records, wearable, implantable, injectable and ingestible digital medical devices, health mobile apps as well as the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to medical and public health prognosis and decision-making. As is often the case with technological advancement, progress in digital health raises compelling ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). This article aims to succinctly map relevant ELSI of the digital health field. The issues of patient autonomy; assessment, value attribution, and validation of health innovation; equity and trustworthiness in healthcare; professional roles and skills and data protection and security are highlighted against the backdrop of the risks of dehumanization of care, the limitations of machine learning-based decision-making and, ultimately, the future contours of human interaction in medicine and public health. The running theme to this article is the underlying tension between the promises of digital health and its many challenges, which is heightened by the contrasting pace of scientific progress and the timed responses provided by law and ethics. Digital applications can prove to be valuable allies for human skills in medicine and public health. Similarly, ethics and the law can be interpreted and perceived as more than obstacles, but also promoters of fairness, inclusiveness, creativity and innovation in health. © Copyright © 2021 Cordeiro.

AB  - Advanced technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, have beenpushing nowadays societies toward new ethical and legal challenges, including copyright law dilemmas. The contemporarydevelopment of innovativemachinesand cognitive technologies raisesthe need to rethink basic concepts such as ownership and accountability. In light of the rules of copyright law, this paper argues that innovative algorithms, such as GPT-3 (an autoregressive language model developed by Open AI to produce human-like text via deep learning), could be considered a modern form of ghostwriting brought forward by the Third Industrial Revolution, as defined by Jeremy Rifkin. The phenomenon of ghostwriting has beennotorioussinceantiquity. Althoughghostwritingis also quitepervasive today, neither national nor international legal systems have yet fully regulated it. Based on the assumption  that AI systems operate likeghostwriters in terms of their creativity, this paperasks whether AI’s creationshould be subject to copyright regulations soon, and if so, to what extent. © 2022, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources.

AB  - The embodiment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday use products is raising challenges and opportunities for HCI and design research, such as human understandings of AI's functions and states, passing back and forth of control, ethics, transparency and user experience. To respond to these challenges, HCI and design researchers have been working on research areas such as Explainable AI (XAI); Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT); Human-Centered AI, as well as guidelines for Human-AI interaction design. Consequently, the interest in studying interaction modalities and their contributions to understandable and transparent AI has been growing. However, the tangible and embodied modality of interaction and more broadly studies of the forms of such everyday use products are relatively under-explored. This paper builds upon a larger project on designing graspable AI and it introduces a series of concept cards that aim to aid design researchers' creative and critical exploration of tangible and understandable AI space. We conducted a user study in two parts of online sessions and semi-structured interviews and found out that to envision physicality and tangible interaction with AI felt challenging and "too abstract". Even so, the act of creative exploration of that space not only supported the participants to gain new design perspectives, but also supported them to go beyond anthropomorphic forms of AI. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which “intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity” [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The conventional method of design education has historically relied on archetypes as the foundation for shaping the appearance and utility of various creations. This longstanding tradition of employing archetypes constrains designers’ creativity by limiting their options. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers an escape from these shackles as it can detect patterns and generate innovative designs beyond the established archetypes. However, it is essential to find an equilibrium between harnessing the capabilities of AI in creating designs and maintaining the uniqueness that stems from human thought processes. We can achieve this by acknowledging archetypal bases’ value and exploring new materials and technologies. This approach enriches our creations with an enduring quality while adapting them to modern society’s evolving desires and requirements. The interplay between traditional archetypes and cutting-edge innovation prompts deep philosophical inquiries concerning design’s essence, the nature of human creativity, and the interrelation between heritage and advancement. Moreover, incorporating text-driven inspirations in art and design education brings many prospects and hurdles. This integration necessitates a departure from the orthodox art and design instruction methods, favoring an embrace of cross-disciplinary viewpoints and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning. It is also vital for educators to tackle the ethical aspects related to the use of AI-generated designs and to equip students with the knowledge to make judicious decisions. By fostering analytical thinking abilities and promoting the exploration of non-traditional expressive forms, students can broaden their creative horizons and venture beyond the confines of artistic conventions. Through this balanced blend of respecting tradition and embracing innovation, future designers can shape a landscape rich in creativity and practicality and reflective of the ever-evolving tapestry of human society. © 2024 Alexander Manu.

AB  - This chapter discusses the expected learning outcomes in entrepreneurship education, including creativity, innovation, industry-specific knowledge, decision-making, risk-taking, problem-solving, leadership qualities, ethics, and social responsibility. It examines whether the conventional entrepreneurial curriculums successfully contribute to the academic and social goals. It also presents a discussion on why the recent socio-cultural, technological, and pandemic-related changes, including mass digitalization, working remotely, asynchronicity, and global communities of practice, demand new approaches to post-secondary entrepreneurship education. It further explores artificial intelligence (AI), such as the virtual classroom, AI tutor, interactive smart boards, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), simulation, and big data systems as a disruptive technology in education. While computer systems with 'intelligence' are already performing many tasks that were commonly associated with humans, there are growing interests, concerns, and uncertainty regarding the wider application of AI in education. A discussion on the trends in AI adoption in education and how AI is likely to reshape curriculums, teaching, and assessment, as well as its impacts on teaching and learning, is considered. Furthermore, it explores the enormous potential of AI specifically in entrepreneurship education. A rich discussion is presented on the possibilities and conditions for an effective instructor-AI collaboration that can make an important contribution to entrepreneurship education, such as the curriculums, instruction, assessment, and feedback. An instructor-AI collaboration has the potential to improve pedagogical practices, learner motivation, and engagement, which are critical to achieving learning outcomes. The chapter concludes with the argument that while integrating AI in entrepreneurship education is capital intensive, it is worth investing in AI as it facilitates the progress of learners by providing them with customized learning support without unduly limiting individual choice. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - New learning researches proved that creativity is an essential concern in the arena of education. The best means to evaluate learning outcomes and students’ creativity is essay questions. However, to evaluate these questions is a time-consuming task and subjectivity in scoring assessments remains inevitable. Automated essay evaluation systems (AEE) provide a cost-effective and consistent alternative to human marking. Therefore, numerous automatic essay-grading systems have been developed to lessen the demands of manual essay grading. However, these systems concentrate on syntax and vocabulary, and no consideration is paid to the semantic and coherence of the essay. Moreover, few of the existing systems are able to give informative feedback that is based on extensive domain knowledge to students. In this paper, a system is evolved that uses latent semantic analysis (LSA) and fuzzy ontology to evaluate essays, where LSA will be responsible for checking the semantic. Fuzzy ontology is used to check the consistency and coherence of the essay as it is the best way to overcome the vagueness of the language, and the system will also provide a score with feedback to the student. Experimental results were good in evaluating the essay syntactically and semantically. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The concept of morality underpins the moral responsibility that not only depends on the outward practices (or 'output', in the case of humanoid robots) of the agents but on the internal attitudes ('input') that rational and responsible intentioned beings generate. The primary question that has initiated extensive debate, i.e. 'Can humanoid robots be moral?', stems from the normative outlook where morality includes human conscience and socio-linguistic background. This paper advances the thesis that the conceptions of morality and creativity interplay with linguistic human beings instead of non-linguistic humanoid robots, as humanoid robots are indeed docile automata that cannot be responsible for their actions. To eradicate human ethics in order to make way for humanoid robot ethics highlights the moral actions and adequacy that hinges the myth of creative agency and self-dependency, which a humanoid robot can scarcely express. © The author 2018.

AB  - The advancement of technology has brought society to the Internet of Things industry. Businesses become more efficient due the technology development via innovation and creativity. New business model creation due to the Internet has changed employment and transaction practices. The emergence of new business models and efficiency has created ethical issues and challenges such as sharing economy employment sustainability, inequality, robot, artificial intelligence in the workplace, and unemployment due to technological advancement. Business ethics is not an exclusive norm developed by business players. Society has its social standards, which will be applied to every aspect of human life, including business. What is right and wrong in the community will be perceived similarly to business practices. Hence, people will not evaluate the business practice based on company perception but on their norms. Consequently, with the radical changes in business models and practices, a new consensus of business ethics between companies and society may be developed to accommodate and balance between companies and society norms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This chapter explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence into the learning environment to guide students on how to augment their human intelligence. It advocates thoughtful adoption of AI to realize benefits while mitigating risks. Key practices include fostering inquiry-driven learning, cultivating critical thinking, enhancing curriculum with adaptive content and assessment, stimulating creativity and innovation through AI prompts and simulations, enabling personalized trajectories, and upskilling students in AI fluencies. However, human wisdom must direct integration aligned with core values. AI generated content and personalization should complement teacher guidance and social learning. Assessment must evolve to nurture ethical discernment and integrity. With prudent implementation elevating human ingenuity, AI can expand possibilities for developing talented, creative individuals who consciously apply technology for shared prosperity. © 2023, IGI Global.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly capable of autonomous generation of creative and inventive works that potentially warrant intellectual property (IP) protections. This paper analyzes the implications of granting AI systems legal authorship and ownership status over output like patents and copyrights. Benefits, including appropriately incentivizing AI innovation and allowing compensation for human contributors, are discussed. However, risks around over-concentration of AI rights, economic disruption, algorithmic bias, and human dignity also arise. Analysis proposes solutions encompassing IP policy reforms, transparency requirements, and oversight mechanisms to ensure responsible implementation. But significant legal ambiguities and coordination challenges remain regarding AI taking on creative roles comparable to humans. This paper aims to spur discourse on adapting IP frameworks and economic models to an AI future characterized by autonomous generation of inventions and works. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In the manufacturing sector, the most important impact of AI would be to improve productivity and to introduce simplicity into the development process through mechanising activities traditionally done by humans. While a step towards complete automation has its own precision and productivity advantages, it poses socio-economic and ethical issues which need to be resolved before AI is completely implemented into the manufacturing industry. The recent success of industrial AI has many explanations for its presence. More affordable sensors and the automatic data collection process; more effective computer processing capabilities to execute more complicated tasks with lower costs at a faster pace, Faster networks for networking and more open cloud platforms for outsourcing data storage and processing resources. For the automotive sector, adaptation and creativity are highly important. This progress could contribute to sustainable production through the usage of modern technology. Over the last few years, the research has based on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) manufactures field and evaluated the massive increase of major technologies of current ‘Web plus AI’ age which provides a strong change in designs, processes, and communities of the industrial sector and also in the creation of AI. The following paper proposes new smart production systems and forms, the development of intelligent manufacturing processes and the intelligent research and technology architecture, based on the integration of AI innovation with information sharing, production and associated product technologies. This paper is an analysis of the impacts of AI in the production sector. © 2021, Scibulcom Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence in the field of art raises questions about its creative capacity, its influence on the essence and appreciation of art, as well as the role of the artist. This research conducts a systematic review of the literature to address these questions with a focus on music and to understand the state of the art. Currently, there are AIs that have the ability to generate compositions autonomously, raising the question of whether the perception of originality and beauty changes when a machine creates. By simulating cognitive processes, AI provides insights into the manifestation of human creativity. However, human creativity is unique, influenced by emotions and experiences. In contrast, machines rely on replicating pre-existing patterns, but with the right guidance, they can enhance human creativity. Even so, they require constant calibration, relying on human criteria to judge their output. The convergence of technology and creativity has led to debates about ethics and copyright of works. It is crucial that technology be at the service of the human being, underlining the urgency of establishing a firm ethical framework in our digital age. © 2023 Universidade Federal de Goias.

AB  - The paper seeks to define the concept of plug-ins jungle as generative background in computational design for new forms of dynamic relationship between human and artificial creativity. This definition will be conducted through the use of theoretical references and practical case studies with the intent to show that the current evolution of a plug-ins jungle is affecting design results at all its scales – from product design to urban design – and at all its stages – from design conception to construction and fabrication. In the past twenty years, the creation of software applications during the design process has exponentially increased in every design-related disciple and the use of plug-ins is giving birth to a new algorithmic evolution of creativity. One of the most interesting examples regarding such matter corresponds to the graphical algorithmic editor Grasshopper and the generation of a series of animal-named plug-ins through which graphically editing the coding process. Grasshopper and its plug-ins represent the touchstone of the ongoing evolution of a new digital jungle in which new software applications are not only augmenting human creativity, but they are also generating new forms of artificial creativity in themselves. The evidence suggests that the increasing use and creation of software applications during the design process is giving birth to new forms of dynamic relationship between human and artificial intelligence, an inbuilt dynamism through which the human mind and the machine constantly interact with each other producing unexpected and emergent design results. © 2019, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

AB  - It is certainly a truism to say that the law has not kept pace with technological developments; and this old truth becomes particularly relevant in the field of artificial intelligence. The discussion on the need for regulation has gathered exceptional momentum in recent years, as it has become increasingly clear that the existing legal framework is simply inadequate in many areas. However, the current debate on AI is still targeted towards formulating proposals concerning the fundamentals: the ethics of AI design and operation, the risks involved, the protection of fundamental rights, the protection of general data and, more broadly, human dignity, autonomy, subjectivity and privacy. In our opinion, despite its necessity, such reflection is no longer sufficient. A technological revolution is taking place in front of our eyes that will have a significant impact on all areas of law. Artificial Intelligence must be incorporated in some way into civil law, with its distant roots in Roman law. In our view, this cannot be done through cosmetic changes, relating only to certain areas (e.g. civil liability or copyright law): not only are such changes insufficient, they do not create any coherent picture. The debate regarding the creativity of robots cannot, in our view, exist in isolation from its counterpart concerning the legal capacity of AI or their personal rights: the discussion on the subjectivity of agents cannot leave aside issues of property, among others. However, it is also not correct to incorporate Artificial Intelligence “by force” into known constructs. Such shortcuts are evident, for example, in the idea of giving AI subjectivity, which, one could argue, would solve all problems in one go, deus ex machina. Nor can we believe that AI is just another new tool (technology) that can be described without difficulty through already known constructs. We believe the matter is much more complicated, and the emergence of AI, an autonomous entity with superhuman capabilities, whose field of action is constantly expanding, will have far-reaching consequences for civil law transactions. The emergence of AI will be a meteorite hitting the legal system, and it should be treated as such; to this extent, there is a need for a comprehensive, coherent concept covering private law, and this book serves to present a possible approach to achieving this. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The concept of art has transposed meaning and medium across time, with its context being a deciding factor for its evolution. However, human beings’ innermost functionality remains the same, and art, to this day, serves as an expression of the subconscious. Accelerated by the conception of GANs in 2014, automation has become a central medium in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Art. However, this raises concern over AI’s influence on artistic autonomy within the process of creativity. This paper proposes ethical care towards maintaining the artist’s volition in exercising autonomy in AI Art and utilizes principles of self-determination theory alongside fundamental limits of creativity to do so. © 2022 Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC 2022.

AB  - This is a decidedly Tocquevillian statement in which I give voice to my concern that the spread of AI may encourage a view of the (epistemic, moral, artistic) creativity of human beings as a refined, but nonetheless mechanical, variety of imitation. In my paper, I take seriously the widespread fears about the development of increasingly sophisticated AI devices in order to understand whether they convey some morally relevant intuitions. An unbridled use of algorithms would not be a big problem as such, if it did not take place within a society in which a form of disenchantment is systematically endorsed, that actually amounts to a tacit, but, precisely for this reason, even more disturbing debunking of humanity and its ability to change for the better © 2021, BioLaw Journal.

AB  - The article presents the author’s approach to constructing a methodology for forecasting and evaluating the development of anthropological profiles, human constitutions depending on changes in the complex living environment of a person (nature, society, technology, virtual reality). The proposed methodology is based on the concepts of quantum-synergetic anthropology and the author’s method of civilizational umwelt analysis. The processes of transferring human intellectual competencies using AI to various umvelts through a network digital matrix of cyber-umvelts, primarily umvelts of technology and virtual reality, are discussed. In the new cyber society, man is already becoming only one of the “intelligent” actors, new forms of hybrid culture and anthropological profiles of generalized physicality are emerging. So, digital painting of neural networks is being sold at expensive auctions, and autonomous intelligent assistants or a unique ChatGPT project are already able to create scientific reviews and even theses of quite satisfactory quality, although not shining with originality. The fundamental question is the prospects for the development of generalized physicality in hybrid systems, from digital drug addiction in virtual worlds of pleasure, to synergistic cooperation between humans and AI in scientific creativity. Turning to the near-term perspective of digital societies, three clusters of their development are identified: the path of China’s social rating, inclusive capitalism of the West, and the project of a harmonious multipolar world. The latter project is just being formed and has a culturocentric nature of the ethics of cooperation, and not a crowd-elitist technocratic one. Today, the problem of choosing between the prospects of network digital democracy, digital totalitarianism, alarmism, digital religion or the harmonization of hybrid digital reality is in full growth. © 2023, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - This paper aims to expound and develop the idea of work as enterprise in response to the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution and to demonstrate that Christian theology provides a conceptual framework which helps locate work within an understanding of purpose and human dignity. This paper defines enterprise, considers the purpose of work, and reflects on themes from the common Christian theological tradition which give meaning to the idea of work as enterprise. Further, this article considers the challenge of technology, the place of the market and ethics, the role of innovation and creativity, questions of freedom and regulation, the central place for the development of skills and education, and the transformational nature of work. In addition, this paper has three policy propositions and some practical advice. Work matters because it is at root an expression of our humanity. Technological advance poses both perils and opportunities. The development of the idea of work as enterprise within a framework of Christian theology places entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation at the heart of our collective response to the fourth industrial revolution. © Business & Professional Ethics Journal.

AB  - In the artwork Syntropic Counterpoints: Metaphysics of The Machines, we explore the phenomena of AI aesthetic and challenge machine abstraction with the eternal question about philosophical topics such as moral, ethics, human existence, God, evil, war. We are making Philosophers AI Clones and giving them words and grammar as a creative tool to make worlds “beyond” the world, existing and non-existing realities, like humans, do. In our conceptual approach, we are led by Nietzsche claim that grammar is the “Metaphysics of the People”. Accordingly, grammar, content, and vision generated during the philosophical discussion between our AI clones are "Metaphysics of Machines". As a result, we can experience machine realities and absurdity and start to question our own. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Fields as diverse as art, photography, writing, and design are now confronting the consequences of easily available—and easy to use—generative systems. Text and image products that used to be understood as direct expressions of the minds of a human creator may now be generated synthetically through software and neural networks. The emergence of such ‘smart’ software poses novel ethical challenges for the evaluation of intellectual products like images and text. There has been a predictable backlash against incursions of automation and generative systems into creative practices that have evolved over centuries. The author surveys critical perspectives on these software systems as they relate to creative practices, and cites examples of how tools and services made possible by neural networks have caused controversy. Further, based on history and trends in mainstream digital culture, the author concludes that popular notions of authorship and creativity will continue to evolve as machine learning and artificial intelligence become increasingly entwined in production tools. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - ChatGPT became the most popular Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital technology platform in history after its launch in November 2022. According to the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, because it reached one million users within five days, and 100 million users within two months, ChatGPT marked an inflection point in society. This study presents a scoping review of the sentiments on ChatGPT in scholarly discourse from 67 publications on the topic. The sentiments were thematically analyzed manually, using ChatGPT and using the new AI function in Atlas.ti®. ChatGPT offered the most comprehensive and versatile analysis even though its results were only used for demonstrative purposes. The key findings reveal a majority positive sentiment from scholars on ChatGPT mainly citing how academia should co-exist with the tool, and for researchers, organizations and society to use ChatGPT to stir greater creativity and productivity. The limited negative and risk sentiments centered around ethical concerns, contradictions, and apprehension about the impact of ChatGPT, through dependency, on human social and cognitive functions in decision-making and judgement. The main recommendations comprise a call for educational reform, training on better usage of ChatGPT, and making the world a better place. The main non-technology focus of ChatGPT research is on “human”, “ethics” and “decision-making”. The study similarly makes a recommendation for educational reform given the transdisciplinary effect of AI, and for academia, society and organizations to intentionally take advantage of the inflection point to create progressive policies on the maximal use of ChatGPT and other AI tools. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence nowadays is an intriguing medium for the new generation of contemporary artists. They are many approaches to the utilization of AI as creative media. Our creative practice and art-based research approach challenge artificial intelligence abstraction and automated content creation with notable philosophical publications. We move the medium beyond traditional usage and interpretations by designing AI agents more independent and engaged in creation through new types of robot-robot interactions. The medium as such is not any more in complete control of an artist and known artistic practices. Hence, we need to extend our aesthetical and conceptual judgments from solely human to human and robot creativity analysis. Consequently, we aim to raise some of the fundamental questions about artificial intelligence’s impact on future human-AI society. This paper will present the two artworks, "Robosophy Philosophy" and "Botorikko, Machine Created State", which are part of the Syntropic Counterpoints ongoing art-based research project. The key novelty in these installations is the use of artificial intelligence - artificial intelligence interaction and universal but abstract human knowledge to investigate AI creative and mindful potentials. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Until now, the mass spread of fake news and its negative consequences have implied mainly textual content towards a loss of citizens' trust in institutions. Recently, a new type of machine learning framework has arisen, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) – a class of deep neural network models capable of creating multimedia content (photos, videos, audio) that simulate accurate content with extreme precision. While there are several areas of worthwhile application of GANs – e.g., in the field of audio-visual production, human-computer interactions, satire, and artistic creativity – their deceptive uses, at least as currently foreseeable, are just as numerous and worrying. The main concern is linked to the so-called “deepfakes”, fake images or videos that simulate real events with extreme precision. When trained on a human face, GANs can make the face assume hyper-realistic movements, expressions and (verbal and non-verbal) communication abilities. This technology poses an urgent threat to the governance of democratic processes concerning the production of public opinions and political discourses, with significant potential for reality-altering and disinformation. After a short introduction of their current technical state-of-the-art, in this paper, we want to enquire about the GANs` socio-technical system alongside different and intertwined philosophical accounts. Firstly, we will argue about the conditions that make perceived GANs-generated content trustworthy, arguing also about the general effects GANs might have on the perceived trustworthiness of individuals. Thereafter, we will discuss about the inadequacy to approach GANs only as perception-altering technology. Against this backdrop, we will propose a theoretical turn that considers the human-machine relationships of trustworthiness as elements of broader hybrid socio-technical systems. This turn comes up with political repercussions that we will discuss in the last part of the paper. © 2023 Humana Mente. All rights reserved.

AB  - As intelligent products and services become our new normal, discussions about user needs gain traction. This paper explores the state-of-The-Art literature on the intersection of design methodologies and data-intensive software development. Considering 16 papers out of 182 from 2017-2023, the extent to which user-centered approaches have already found their way into dataintensive software development processes was examined. Here, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), Human-Centered Explainable Artificial Intelligence (HCXAI), and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) were identified. Second, existing frameworks and case studies that combine Design Thinking (DT) and AI development were examined. Although DT has been found to be valuable in software development due to its focus on empathy, problem definition, and interdisciplinarity, this paper argues that user-centeredness still falls short and should be considered more consequently, especially in the early stages of development where empathy for the user, the understanding of the problem, and concrete ideas are formed. © 2023 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Some of the most interesting news from the frontiers of machine intelligence is about the triumphs in the domains traditionally considered “creative.” The attempts to generate aesthetically pleasing patterns and images using computers are as old as the invention of the computer itself. With the advent of powerful AI algorithms, it is now possible to train neural networks to generate images not only in a particular artistic style but in completely new styles as well. In other realms of human creativity, algorithms are being used in “proving” mathematical theorems, composing music, writing screenplays, and generating snippets of poetry. This chapter outlines the history of computer-generated art, followed by the recent advances in machine intelligence as applied to the creative fields. Finally, it briefly discusses the philosophical, ethical and legal questions related to ownership of AI-generated or AI-assisted creative work. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Diffusion is an area of research exploring the interactive relationship between human consciousness and computational practice by analyzing human brain data from electroen-cephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces and interactive devices that can generate music and synchronized visual images by biofeedback. Although interactive experience is not a new topic in computational art, it has provoked thought due to the significant influence of technology on human ideology, emotions, morality, ethics, etc. Diffusion is the result of attempts to establish a connection between human physiological information and digital technology. As well as experimental research, it based on the ethical level of artificial intelligence (AI). Diffusion uses music visualization to transform intangible brain activity (thoughts or emotions) into perceivable things (sounds or objects). The research emphasizes human consciousness in AI and points out the blurred boundaries between AI and human creativity. Therefore, the installation evaluates human motivation, which can present as abstract structures—like creativity, emotion, and insight—which enhance the interactive experience of participants and deconstructs the inherent meaning of the material and spiritual, reality and virtual reality or humans and machines. By reviewing and contextualizing EEG and digital music development research, we finally outline a future research area that will involve deep collaboration across interdisciplinary and multiple technologies to realize emotion recognition. © 2021, Shuai Xu, Zhe Wang.

AB  - The increasing availability of easy-To-Access generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, like ChatGPT, calls for a need in education to devise new learning scenarios in view of their potential and challenges. Learning Analytics (LA) can play an important role in the understanding and optimization of responsible and reflective uses of AI tools in education. This paper contributes to the exploration of this role, adopting a human-centered perspective. The paper studies the perspectives of professors and students participating in a 'generative AI for learning' training at a public university in Spain. Considering these perspectives, the paper discusses new requirements for learning analytics in these new learning scenarios using AI. The perspectives highlight the potential of these tools as learning assistants, enabling improved use of study time, stimulating creativity, and facilitating personalized feedback. Stakeholders also points out several ethical concerns and risks that may hinder learning. These preliminary results emphasize the need for LA to differentiate between AI-Assisted and AI-complement actions and human intelligence at work, aligned with pedagogical intentions. The paper formulates high-level constructs for learning analytics differentiating those actions, illustrated with examples. The paper also discusses that ethical concerns, like student inequality in accessing advanced tools, should be factored into analytics and decision-making tools. © 2023 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) into scientific writing, especially in medical literature, presents both unprecedented opportunities and inherent challenges. This manuscript evaluates the transformative potential of LLMs for the synthesis of information, linguistic enhancements, and global knowledge dissemination. At the same time, it raises concerns about unintentional plagiarism, the risk of misinformation, data biases, and an over-reliance on AI. To address these, we propose governing principles for AI adoption that ensure integrity, transparency, validity, and accountability. Additionally, guidelines for reporting AI involvement in manuscript development are delineated, and a classification system to specify the level of AI assistance is introduced. This approach uniquely addresses the challenges of AI in scientific writing, emphasizing transparency in authorship, qualification of AI involvement, and ethical considerations. Concerns regarding access equity, potential biases in AI-generated content, authorship dynamics, and accountability are also explored, emphasizing the human author’s continued responsibility. Recommendations are made for fostering collaboration between AI developers, researchers, and journal editors and for emphasizing the importance of AI’s responsible use in academic writing. Regular evaluations of AI’s impact on the quality and biases of medical manuscripts are also advocated. As we navigate the expanding realm of AI in scientific discourse, it is crucial to maintain the human element of creativity, ethics, and oversight, ensuring that the integrity of scientific literature remains uncompromised.

AB  - This paper questions the notion of creativity found in certain artworks produced with A.I. technologies. The artistic examples concerned are: The Giver of names by David Rokeby, Oscar by Catherine Ikam and Louis Fléri, and Emotion Vending Machine by Maurice Benayoun. These artworks were selected because they stand out for their autonomous behavior in front of the human public. In this context, creativity is revealed as a consequence of the functional autonomy, which is very typical of these pieces of art. The intention is to establish a relationship between the notion of autonomy and that of creativity, reviewing their meanings and applications in philosophy and in the field of life science. For this, the notion of autonomy is approached from Kant’s definition as a decisive value indicating the moral principle that defines the individual and his free conduct, and then approached as a property of life from Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana’s research. Autonomy is also a tendency that characterizes a general process of technical lineages according to Chapoutier and Kaplan. In all these studies, autonomy presents complementary meanings that help us to draw parallels with the notion of creativity. The analyzed artworks allow us to visualize some ways of simulating creativity, while offering unique aesthetic experiences. From a broader perspective, this paper promotes the vision that some computer artworks open up as multisensory and multiconceptual universes, projecting original ideas, and making us feel the very human substance of these technologies. Interacting with these artworks, we are placed at the heart of the aesthetic metamorphosis provoked by the phenomenon of the computer revolution. © 2023, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

AB  - Hannah Arendt's work "Vita Activa and The Human Condition" is considered one of the most important ethical and moral writings of our time. The philosopher understands practical life as an inescapable human condition, as condicio humana. Practical philosophy, which includes ethics and morality, is situated between work and society. There, technology finds its application. Meanwhile technology's influence has gained the ability to shape culture, as artificial intelligence (AI) and transhumanism show. This influence has come to be viewed increasingly critically by scientists, who see it as often violating human boundaries. In the ethical evaluation of a course of action oriented on technology, we follow a traditionally Aristotelian distinction between poesis (greek) and praxis (greek). With poesis we mean an instrumental, purposeful production process, which is realized through implementation and completed in the finished product. With praxis we define human activity, or communal work. Arendt interprets the technical processes of conception and work as creativity. As homofaber, the "tool-maker", we want to make the world more beautiful and useful. As animal laborans, we want to make our lives easier and longer. Today, many of us try to orient ourselves in our everyday lives through technology, such as voice-controlled software. However, in order orient ourselves in the world, it is not technology that is necessary, but rather human intelligence and practical action. This paper illuminates Arendt's interpretation of the human condition as practical action, and emphasizes the lessons it provides for ethical education in acoustic engineering. © INTER-NOISE 2021 .All right reserved.

AB  - AI and data science are like magical tools that are changing how businesses work all around the world! This is 21 st century, and it could be called the digital era of AI and Data Science for entrepreneurship, as every entrepreneur is excited to use AI and Data Science in its business. It is of no doubt that if entrepreneur wants innovation, growth and success, it has to use these. When we say 'Artificial Intelligence,' we're usually talking about very complicated computer programs that are made to act like humans in ways like planning, fixing problems, and learning. It's genuinely captivating to witness how AI's prowess is transforming the business landscape, creating a path filled with thrilling possibilities in this digital age. The way AI is reshaping businesses and opening up new horizons is truly fascinating and holds great promise for the future. The way businesses operate is undergoing a significant transformation, and it's remarkable to witness the impact AI is having on their journey towards success. However, likening AI to a 'vehicle' in its general reference does capture a certain level of accuracy, yet it lacks the granularity required to delineate the distinct capabilities that set AI apart. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the prevailing AI applications in the realm of businesses, a more in-depth exploration into the various types of AI becomes imperative. In practice, AI primarily assumes the role of a supportive tool, augmenting and enhancing human intelligence and creativity rather than supplanting it altogether. Notably, its salient advantage lies in its ability to rapidly process and comprehend vast quantities of data, outpacing the cognitive capacities of the human brain, thus empowering businesses with unparalleled analytical prowess and data-driven decision-making abilities. However, it still struggles with tasks that humans find easy in the real world, lacking common sense. The research paper at hand explores the pivotal role of AI and Data Science in transforming entrepreneurship. The paper sheds light on the significant impact of these technologies on decision-making, customer experience, product development, and business models. Additionally, it delves into the complexities, challenges, and ethical considerations that arise when integrating AI and Data Science. Through real-world case studies and industry trends analysis, the document provides valuable insights into the dynamic landscape of 21 st-century entrepreneurship.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and large language models (LLM) made their fulgurant irruption in our society at all levels, inclusive in health care. Possible applications and proofs of concept are everywhere. There is without any reasonable doubt an enormous potential, especially nowadays as we are facing an ever-growing imbalance between the flux of data and the availability of human resources. The creativity of GAI will be highlighted in the quest of defining protein structures and search for new medications, as well as for the development and use of digital twins in clinical research. As far as LLM's are concerned, we need to make a distinction between general models and models dedicated specifically to healthcare. Again, making an extensive overview of used cases is becoming impossible today, facing the numerous publications in the field.; Les mots intelligence artificielle générative (GAI) et modèles linguistiques larges (LLM) sont devenus ubiquitaires et incontournables en un temps record. En médecine aussi, le nombre d’applications possibles et preuves de concept foisonnent. Le potentiel est effectivement énorme, en particulier aujourd’hui, dans un monde de soins en déséquilibre, caractérisé par un flux énorme de données et un manque de moyens humains. La force créative de la GAI est illustrée par un exemple issu de la recherche protéomique et le développement de nouveaux médicaments, ainsi que dans le monde de la recherche clinique avec le développement des jumeaux digitaux. Pour le LLM, il faut faire la distinction entre modèles généralistes et spécialisés (adaptés au monde des soins). Là aussi, il devient de plus en plus difficile aujourd’hui d’en faire une revue exhaustive, car la littérature abonde de cas d’usage.

AB  - This article is a reflection on the relevance of Joseph Weizenbaum’s ethics today on the occasion of his 100th birthday. Today, there are many debates about the impact of AI technologies such as ChatGPT on society. Weizenbaum understood himself not as a computer and AI critic, but as a critic of society. He situated the problems of computing in the context of society. The paper shows that in the spirit of Weizenbaum we should also in the contemporary age of advanced AI remind ourselves that computers cannot understand, do not have feelings, and therefore cannot do many things that humans actively and consciously do. © 2023, Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

AB  - Since the advent of the postdigital era, technologies have been dramatically transforming human lives, shifting the ways humans communicate, learn, and create. This article aims to envision how entanglements with nonhuman intelligences can unsettle and reshape pedagogical approaches in the field of art education. I argue for the need to reconceptualize relations between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) as collaborative and symbiotic relationships beyond instrumental understandings, which are informed by posthuman perspectives. Reframing human–AI relations will help art educators and researchers not only explore the potential of AI for new inquiry and creativity in art curricula, but also critically examine possible ethical issues for its implementation in art classrooms. By looking at how AI has been explored in new media art projects that intersect emergent intelligences and art pedagogy, I investigate their implications for future art education. © 2023 National Art Education Association.

AB  - This study explores the impact and perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern society, focusing on the attitudes of young individuals in Kazan, Russia. The purpose of the research is to investigate the integration of AI into various facets of life and its implications. Employing qualitative and quantitative research methods, the study assembles a diverse focus group and conducts a sociological survey among 2206 Russian youth to gauge digital socialization and competencies. The results reveal that AI, in its current state, serves as a valuable support tool for professional, educational, and creative tasks but is not viewed as a complete replacement for human capabilities. However, concerns arise regarding potential job displacement, creativity's degradation, and data security threats.

AB  - Our paper investigates what forms the knowledge work design on a corporate level in the future. The future might be 2025, 2030, or 2035. The methodology includes interviews with researchers working with these issues in the Swedish telecommunication company Telia and the Norwegian telecommunication company Telenor. These companies make their living from understanding the future of work both on a corporate and societal level. The main finding is that AI and robotics will be more advanced, but the main changes will be management and organizational structure. The work will be done more as distance work and through virtual teams. The management and organization of work through the coronavirus have opened for more work done independent of time and the workplace and in virtual teams. There is also predicted a lack of professionals and all types of employees in the years to come, leading both to a competition for talent and increased importance in keeping the employed knowledge workers through internal career pipelines. AI and robotics will not reduce the need for professionals and employees. The steps will be taken one by one towards an integrated digitalization that makes new opportunities for collaboration, communication, and knowledge work. The fundamental knowledge worker will be using more of his working time on significant business issues. The skills needed are technical, information management, knowledge management, project management, collaboration, communication, rhetoric, virtual team, creativity, and green problem-solving skills. There is a corporate need for ethical, cultural, tolerating, and sexual awareness. We may summarize the needs as creative, sustainable, social and perception manipulation intelligence. The knowledge of the future will be complex, and the knowledge worker will handle multiple skills in different situations. The work of the future will be dominated by increasingly autonomous workers co-opting automated digital systems to create and capture value. The education might be revamped into a more task-focused education offered through the work life cycles. The revamping of education will also increase the overall employment and we will not experience the mass unemployment described in the literature as the result of AI, robotics, and digitalization. We have identified that the literature uses the unit occupation and not the unit tasks for the predicted higher unemployment and get a misinterpretation of negative consequences. The environmental issues and the climate crisis will be taken very seriously in the years to come and there will be a cooperation between the political economy and the corporate economy to do whatever is possible for sustainability in all internal and external processes to work greener and smarter. We will experience sustainability in action driven by a green leadership through a green strategy and green business models giving green services and products reusing as much as possible and using as few as possible resources to reduce the CO2 gases. This study concludes that there will be many small positive corporate and societal steps for each year towards 2030, improving the way of living and working together with environmental improvements. The reconstruction of the middle class is also emerging — neither a perfect nor an imperfect world. © 2022 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - In virtual collaboration at the workplace, a growing number of teams apply supportive conversational agents (CAs). They take on different work-related tasks for teams and single users such as scheduling meetings or stimulating creativity. Previous research merely focused on these positive aspects of introducing CAs at the workplace, omitting ethical challenges faced by teams using these often artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies. Thus, on the one hand, CAs can present themselves as benevolent teammates, but on the other hand, they can collect user data, reduce worker autonomy, or foster social isolation by their service. In this work, we conducted 15 expert interviews with senior researchers from the fields of ethics, collaboration, and computer science in order to derive ethical guidelines for introducing CAs in virtual team collaboration. We derived 14 guidelines and seven research questions to pave the way for future research on the dark sides of human–agent interaction in organizations. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines how Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the creative process by enabling machines to create art and explore new mediums, technologies, and techniques in artistic expression. The research methodology employed includes a literature review, interviews with leading art professionals, and case studies. The results suggest that AI can be used to expand human creativity by allowing the artist to explore new techniques and technologies as well as to create unique works of art. However, ethical and practical considerations must be considered when working with this type of technology, such as the cost of creating AI-driven art and the imperfect output that can be generated by algorithms. Additionally, AI-driven art may not be accepted into major institutions as its medium, meaning that consideration must be taken to ensure that AI art is presented professionally and respectfully. This paper pursues to provide insight into the impact of AI technology on the creative process and explore the potential benefits and challenges associated with using AI to create artwork. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Bard, are transformer architectures that are based on deep learning techniques. Briefly, they can generate text by predicting the next word in a sentence given all the previous words. Therefore, the choice of which word is used in which place within a sentence depends on probabilities governed by the massive amount of text data used to train them. Additionally, there is an element of randomness intertwined within the LLM algorithm to introduce a measure of inconsistency and simulate a perception of creativity. LLMs can capture long-range dependencies between words, meaning that they can 'understand' the context around a word within a sentence, leading to the perception of coherence and contextual relevance in the generated output. Without keeping how LLMs work in mind, it is easy to anthropomorphise it when interacting with it; one of several factors leading to the sensational uptake and hype in recent months. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

AB  - This paper discusses the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in education, delineating their potential to transform pedagogical practices alongside the challenges they present. Generative AI models like ChatGPT, had a disruptive impact on teaching and learning, due to their ability to create text, images, and sound, revolutionizing educational content creation and modification. However, nowadays the educational community is polarized, with some embracing AI for its accessibility and efficiency thus advocating it as an indispensable tool, while others cautioning against risks to academic integrity and intellectual development. This document is designed to raise awareness about AI tools and provide some examples of how they can be used to improve education and learning. From an educator's perspective, AI is an asset for curriculum development, course material preparation, instructional design and student assessment, while reducing bias and workload. For students, AI tools offer personalized learning experiences, timely feedback, and support in various academic activities. The Turkish Biochemical Society (TBS) Academy recommends educators to embrace and utilize AI tools to enhance educational processes, and engage in peer learning for better adaptation while maintaining a critical perspective on their utility and limitations. The transfer of AI knowledge and methods to the teaching experiences should complement and not replace the educator's creativity and critical thinking. The paper advocates for an informed embrace of AI, AI fluency among educators and students, ethical application of AI in academic settings, and continuous engagement with the evolving AI technologies, ensuring that AI tools are used to augment critical thinking and contribute positively to education and society.  © 2023 the author(s).

AB  - Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in creative works challenges the justifications and effectiveness of Copyright Protection aimed at human authors. AI -assisted musical works influence the value of rights held by stakeholders in the music industry associated with human artists' earnings, the production of new original works, and public access to pro-tected compositions. The lenient approach that allows computer-generated works to invoke copyright protection questions how the law perceives what constitutes 'original' works. The philosophical research question of this paper asks, 'how do AI-assisted works affect our understanding of musical creation and their copyright protection.' The work incorporates a doctrinal approach to expose how AI tools compromise the presumptions behind the originality criteria of creative freedom, independent creation, and human authors' labor, skill, and judgment. Following the creative process adopted in compositions and exposing elements that attract copyright protection, the discourse reveals how AI imposes a quantifiable nature upon melodies. The findings show that the limited spectrum for musical creation and the expedited and low-cost process of AI-assisted compositions undermine justifications behind copyright protection. The paper seeks to expose and bridge the gap between AI tools application and their socio-legal impact on the music industry. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial intelligence, and specifically applications such as ChatGPT, is causing a disruptive change that threatens the “expertise” of professional activities of a technical, scientific and intellectual nature. The generalization and ease of access to artificial intelligence systems will render irrelevant part of the knowledge of professionals who have been trained at the university and who develop their professional activity in fields as diverse as literature, law or engineering. For this reason, universities must adapt and integrate artificial intelligence systems in the student training process, evaluation systems and in the professional activity of teachers and researchers. This article analyzes the disruptive changes that artificial intelligence will cause in the university, both in the teaching and research activities of the university professors. Codes of ethical behavior will have to be reinforced to prevent fraudulent use. The vision given is optimistic and full of opportunities. Artificial intelligence, far from being a problem, will cause critical thinking or the ability to solve problems to enter another dimension. Tedious tasks, such as writing, calculating, drawing and structuring, will be carried out by artificial intelligence and the enormous cognitive capacity that human beings have can be used for tasks related to creativity and innovation. © 2023 Spandidos Publications.

AB  - For a long time, researchers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and futurists have hypothesized that the developed Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems can execute intellectual and behavioral tasks similar to human beings. However, there are two possible concerns regarding the emergence of AGI systems and their moral status, namely: 1) is it possible to grant moral status to the AGI-enabled robots similar to humans? 2) if it is (im)possible, then under what conditions do such robots (fail to) achieve moral status similar to humans? To examine the possibilities, the present study puts forward a functionality argument, which claims that if a human being and an AGI-enabled robot have similar functionality, but different creative processes, they may have similar moral status. Furthermore, the functionality argument asserts that an entity’s (a human being or an AGI-enabled robot) creation/production from carbon or silicon or its brain’s utilization of neurotransmitters or semiconductors does not carry any significance. Rather, if both entities have similar functionality, they may have similar moral status, which implies that the AGI-enabled robot may achieve human-like moral status if it performs human-like functions. © (2023).

AB  - The evolution of technology and science has brought groundbreaking developments to the current visual arts, and the application of digital technology has brought significant changes to the creation and aesthetic taste of traditional art. This study, therefore, investigates the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and applications in generating visual art while giving a brief history of the intersection of AI and art, including the milestone advancements in neural networks. Fifteen interviews were conducted with technical artists who use text-to-image AI generators to gather data. Based on the findings from the interviews, the state-of-the-art applications were reviewed and analyzed in six categories: Accessibility, Barrier to Entry, Novelty, Ethics and Morality, Control, Non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Monetization which were widely discussed along with their success and limitations. The research concludes with three main findings; (a) monetization of digital media through NFTs that has a direct impact on the advancement of art generating AI applications, (b) there is a significant change in the traditional creative process with the integration of AI applications, and AI is not just a tool but it's a creative agent that artists collaborate with (c) art generating AI applications can generate limitless possibilities within the same aesthetics as a result revolutionize the way humans create and interact with art. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The recent wave of generative AI (GAI) systems like Stable Diffusion that can produce images from human prompts raises controversial issues about creatorship, originality, creativity and copyright. This paper focuses on creatorship: who creates and should be credited with the outputs made with the help of GAI? Existing views on creatorship are mixed: some insist that GAI systems are mere tools, and human prompters are creators proper; others are more open to acknowledging more significant roles for GAI, but most conceive of creatorship in an all-or-nothing fashion. We develop a novel view, called CCC (collective-centered creation), that improves on these existing positions. On CCC, GAI outputs are created by collectives in the first instance. Claims to creatorship come in degrees and depend on the nature and significance of individual contributions made by the various agents and entities involved, including users, GAI systems, developers, producers of training data and others. Importantly, CCC maintains that GAI systems can sometimes be part of a co-creating collective. We detail how CCC can advance existing debates and resolve controversies around creatorship involving GAI.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - The rapidly growing field of text-to-image generation leverages machine learning and natural language processing to allow for the creation of very diverse and high-quality images. Whilst these images can be used in various forms and for many purposes, this paper addresses a specific question: The possibility of utilizing text-to-image generators to create concept art for the 3D-modeling process of a character. There is a potential opportunity to explore how these tools can be incorporated in traditional content creators’ pipelines. This opportunity presents itself now because of two factors: The increased capability of these text-to-image tools compared to previous generative models, as well as the lack of specific focus on creators in current research. We propose a possible pipeline to incorporate these new tools in the traditional 3D modeling process, dubbed the ‘vortex process’. This workflow follows a more circular and iterative pattern compared to examples of a more traditional process. The impact of utilizing text-to-image tools is threefold: It can boost the speed of iteration, as the speed of generating new artwork is increased compared to a human; this then allows for the exploration of more variations in a design process. Additionally, it can free up extra time to allow for extra polish of the final product. In this paper we therefore examine how the use of this technology affects the creative process. Finally, we highlight some of the potential ethical and societal implications of this technology: Loss of human jobs, issues regarding copyright of artwork used to train models etc., which will all impact future use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this slide-lecture we formulate a novel paradigm for the mathematical description of mental functions such as consciousness, creativity, decision making and prediction of the future based on the past. Such cognitive functions are described in the framework of canonical nonlinear dynamical models that form joint global hierarchical networks. Sub-networks cooperate and compete with each other by inhibition. The suggested approach uses heteroclinic dynamics to represent transitivity and sequential interaction of different cognitive modalities at all levels of network hierarchy. For the first time we build a model of global network dynamics based on a set of kinetic ecological equations describing the interaction with emotion at each level of the hierarchy. This makes the model applicable for the description and understanding of perception, creativity and other complex cognitive processes. We discuss the creativity phenomenon, for example, in a joint «human-robot mind» considering the approximation in which the artificial partner is responsible for the binding and retrieving of multimodal perception information. The formation of chunks and the creation of working memory is a joint effort – human-robot mind. The human mind is responsible for the evaluation of the information in working memory. Creativity is estimated by Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy. As an example, we discuss joint human-robot musical improvisation, which can be generalized for many applications, in particular, in the context of artificial intelligence applications and to address several psychiatric disorders. © 2017, Saratov State University.

AB  - This special issue focuses on research developments and critical thought in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to modeling and creating music. It is motivated by the AI Song Contests of 2020 and 2021, in which the four guest editors adjudicated or participated among many teams from around the world. The 2020 edition had 13 submissions and the 2021 edition had 38. The 2022 edition is now being planned. These unique events provide exciting opportunities for AI music researchers to test the state of the art and push the boundaries of what is possible, within the context of music creation. They portend a future when humans and machines work together as partners in music creation. Maybe "portend" is not the right term, but we must not think that the future of AI and music is only warm and fuzzy. It is important and timely to consider how we, in local and global contexts, can effectively and ethically develop and apply AI in contexts of music creation. © 2022 Web Portal Ubiquity Press.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence, i.e., complex algorithms that learn to perform functions associated with human minds, such as perceiving, decision-making, and demonstrating creativity. Indeed, more often than not, AI is trained on biased datasets, that is, this data is disproportionately weighted in favor of or against certain individuals or groups of individuals. The roots for such biases are very diverse, sometimes they are technical in nature, but often they originate in the minds of people, making it difficult to identify these biases, e.g. if such a disproportionate weighting is perceived as 'normal' by many, while it is still devastating to few. We argue that the use of virtue ethics in AI can help to mitigate the consequences of biases and to help identify such biases. In particular, we aim to assess in multiple online and field experiments how the virtue 'transparency' affects an individual's decision-making and perceptions regarding the AI. © ICIS 2020.

AB  - This article reports on the influence of an important project of our time, the creation of thinking machines or cyborgs, on the essence of human spirituality. The popular work of Kurzweil was used as a starting point. Kurzweil believes that the cyborgs or man-machine hybrids will not only be a simulation of human cognition but also of consciousness and spirituality. In fact, they will be more than a simulation; they will enhance and alter consciousness and spirituality in a radical, unfathomable way. The basis of Kurzweil's argument is his law of accelerating returns, which predicts such a progress in technology that, if an algorithm for the working of the brain can be formulated, it will be possible to develop software emulating the conscious brain. In this way, current limitations experienced by human beings, including mortality, will be overcome. This assumption was investigated from an anthropological view using Janicaud's concepts. The cyborg is seen as an illustration of people's innate desire to overcome the human condition. Humanity is characterised by a constant struggle to find a balance between the superhuman and the inhuman as the extreme states of human spirituality. This also characterises human liberty - humans are free to choose. Given this characterisation of humanity, the nature of the cyborg as superhuman is then considered. Different possibilities are sketched: the superhuman who will exercise the pure will to power (awakening the inhuman) or a person with a complete naive freedom. The future is not easy to predict. Janicaud considers the view of the cyborg as superhuman to be a myth. The real danger facing humanity is the inhuman. The growth and progress of technology do not guarantee moral progress. Currently, technology seems to create a sharp divide between a privileged few and the rest. The two world wars in the previous century illustrated ways in which technology could be used to commit cold-blooded barbaric acts on a mass scale. In addition, biotechnology and other technological innovations could give rise to new forms of violence which can effectively be spread by new media. The inhuman is a place from where it is difficult to return. The challenge of our time is to carry the responsibility of our freedom in such a way that we can defend ourselves against our inhumanity; but in a manner that would enable us also to open up to the radical creativity and strangeness of superhumans lying dormant in us. It is clear that now, more than ever before, human spirituality needs to be as alive and rich as possible to rise to the challenge. However, the belief in technology as utopia enslaves the human spirit. We forget that we are the creators of technology and fabricate excuses for moral and intellectual abdications. Furthermore, the assumption that cognition can be mechanised or formalised leads to the disembodiment of intelligence and thought. Humans are placed outside of the world to which they belong. We become estranged from ourselves and each other. The human spirit seems to be wounded by the prevailing metaphors of disembodiment and mechanisation accompanying technological dominance. This article contributes to the call for the struggle for the re-enchantment of the human spirit. It is imperative that thinkers and innovators - leaders - create new metaphors to provide richer descriptions of humanity. Social sciences, having studied the human condition for centuries, might contribute valuable ideas. Technology can be used in this struggle, but only if human beings understand their own paradoxical nature as well as that of technology. The fortified spirit is one that accepts its mortality and fragility but takes responsibility for its freedom. In this way, meaning is re-introduced in the lives of human beings.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence has pervaded contemporary societies in almost every way as an externalized, fragmented, and optimized form of rationality. I call this externalized mode of thought “algorithmic rationality” and to the ideology favoring it, “algorithmic reason”. Although algorithmic reason original goal was to facilitate the arising of a highly participative and global Culture, fitting all citizens in a dynamic democratic society, History has it that AI technology would be ceased by consumer logic and computational propaganda. I discuss the economical, epistemological, and political implementation of algorithmic reason, introducing three cases. I argue that such implementation comprises a cybernetic loop, involving a centralized AI and its instrumentalized users. Commenting upon the ubiquity of such loop, I introduce three limitations of algorithmic reason. The first two are of a computational nature. The third owes its presence to a cybernetic loop, producing a steering effect on the human mind and promoting a cultural flattening effect. This, I conclude, may result in the impoverish of creativity, critical thought, and intellectual curiosity. © 2021 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2021.
