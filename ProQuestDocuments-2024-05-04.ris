T1  - A systematic review of Stimulated Recall (SR) in educational research from 2012 to 2022
AN  - 3033794366
AB  - Stimulated Recall (SR) has long been used in educational settings as an approach of retrospection. However, with the fast growing of digital learning and advanced technologies in educational settings over the past decade, the extent to which stimulated recall has been effectively implemented by researchers remains minimal. This systematic review reveals that SR has been primarily employed to probe the patterns of participants’ thinking, to examine the effects of instructional strategies, and to promote metacognitive level. Notably, SR video stimuli have advanced, and the sources of stimuli have become more diverse, including the incorporation of physiological data. Additionally, researchers have applied various strategies, such as flexible intervals and questioning techniques, in SR interviews. Furthermore, this article discusses the relationships between different SR research items, including stimuli and learning contexts. The review and analysis also demonstrate that stimulated recall may be further enhanced by integrating multiple data sources, applying intelligent algorithms, and incorporating conversational agents enabled by generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of SR studies in the realm of education and proposes a promising avenue for researchers to proactively apply stimulated recall in investigating educational issues in the digital era.

T1  - What factors will affect the effectiveness of using ChatGPT to solve programming problems? A quasi-experimental study
AN  - 2931867553
AB  - The emergence of ChatGPT has sparked new expectations for AI-empowered educational transformation. However, it remains unknown which factors affect its effectiveness in empowering learners to solve programming problems. Therefore, this study employed a quasi-experimental research design and used Python graphing in programming education as an example to investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of learners in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving. Findings: AI literacy significantly influences learners’ effectiveness in using ChatGPT to solve problems, with AI awareness and AI usage being key factors. The knowledge base of programming language significantly affects learners’ effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to solve programming problems. Learners’ cognitive level of ChatGPT significantly influences their effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving, while usage intention does not have a significant impact. However, learners’ intention to use ChatGPT significantly improves after application. Based on these findings, this study proposes that in the process of empowering education with Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) products, the focus on learners should shift from cultivating their AI usage to AI literacy, laying the foundation for empowering learning with AIGC products. It is suggested to shift from mastering specific knowledge to graph-based rules as a method for empowering learning with AIGC products. Additionally, the focus should shift from enhancing learners’ intention to use the technology to strengthen their technological awareness, thereby creating practical pathways for empowering learning with AIGC products.

T1  - Artificial cognition vs. artificial intelligence for next-generation autonomous robotic agents
AN  - 2972948848
AB  - The trend in industrial/service robotics is to develop robots that can cooperate with people, interacting with them in an autonomous, safe and purposive way. These are the fundamental elements characterizing the fourth and the fifth industrial revolutions (4IR, 5IR): the crucial innovation is the adoption of intelligent technologies that can allow the development of cyber-physical systems, similar if not superior to humans. The common wisdom is that intelligence might be provided by AI (Artificial Intelligence), a claim that is supported more by media coverage and commercial interests than by solid scientific evidence. AI is currently conceived in a quite broad sense, encompassing LLMs and a lot of other things, without any unifying principle, but self-motivating for the success in various areas. The current view of AI robotics mostly follows a purely disembodied approach that is consistent with the old-fashioned, Cartesian mind-body dualism, reflected in the software-hardware distinction inherent to the von Neuman computing architecture.The working hypothesis of this position paper is that the road to the next generation of autonomous robotic agents with cognitive capabilities requires a fully brain-inspired, embodied cognitive approach that avoids the trap of mind-body dualism and aims at the full integration of Bodyware and Cogniware. We name this approach Artificial Cognition (ACo) and ground it in Cognitive Neuroscience. It is specifically focused on proactive knowledge acquisition based on bidirectional human-robot interaction: the practical advantage is to enhance generalization and explainability. Moreover, we believe that a brain-inspired network of interactions is necessary for allowing humans to cooperate with artificial cognitive agents, building a growing level of personal trust and reciprocal accountability: this is clearly missing, although actively sought, in current AI. The ACo approach is a work in progress that can take advantage of a number of research threads, some of them antecedent the early attempts to define AI concepts and methods. In the rest of the paper we will consider some of the building blocks that need to be re-visited in a unitary framework: the principles of developmental robotics, the methods of action representation with prospection capabilities, and the crucial role of social interaction.

T1  - Enhancing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Learners’ Writing with ChatGPT: A University-Level Course Design: EJEL
AN  - 3045262244
AB  - This research explores the innovative integration of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 within a university-level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing course, illustrating a novel approach to academic instruction. The course follows the ADDIE instructional design model, encompassing five systematic stages: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. This model serves as the backbone of the course structure, ensuring a comprehensive educational experience. The incorporation of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework in this course facilitates the effective integration of GPT-3.5 by enabling instructors to align advanced AI capabilities with appropriate pedagogical strategies, thereby enhancing the learning experience. TPACK guides educators in applying GPT-3.5’s features in a manner that is contextually relevant and pedagogically sound, ensuring the technology’s use complements the course content. The findings from this research are significant. They reveal that GPT-3.5 addresses three fundamental challenges often encountered in academic writing courses. Firstly, it enhances efficiency by providing immediate feedback and generating content ideas, accelerating the writing process. Secondly, GPT-3.5 ensures cohesive organization within students’ writing, guiding them to structure their thoughts more logically. Lastly, it serves as a reliable substitute for traditional peer reviewers, offering critical and objective feedback that students can use to refine their drafts. As students engage with AI, they enter a dynamic partnership. This collaboration with GPT-3.5 fosters critical thinking and empowers students to develop a distinctive writing voice. Through this interaction, students are not merely passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in a learning process that is augmented by cutting-edge technology. This study not only provides insight into the potential of AI-augmented academic writing but also highlights GPT-3.5’s role in promoting writing proficiency. It demonstrates that the application of AI in education can enhance the learning experience without compromising the individuality of student expression.

T1  - Exploring the Feasibility and Efficacy of ChatGPT3 for Personalized Feedback in Teaching: EJEL
AN  - 3045262191
AB  - This study explores the feasibility of using AI technology, specifically ChatGPT-3, to provide reliable, meaningful, and personalized feedback. Specifically, the study explores the benefits and limitations of using AI-based feedback in language learning; the pedagogical frameworks that underpin the effective use of AI-based feedback; the reliability of ChatGPT-3’s feedback; and the potential implications of AI integration in language instruction. A review of existing literature identifies key themes and findings related to AI-based teaching practices. The study found that social cognitive theory (SCT) supports the potential use of AI chatbots in the learning process as AI can provide students with instant guidance and support that fosters personalized, independent learning experiences. Similarly, Krashen’s second language acquisition theory (SLA) was found to support the hypothesis that AI use can enhance student learning by creating meaningful interaction in the target language wherein learners engage in genuine communication rather than focusing solely on linguistic form. To determine the reliability of AI-generated feedback, an analysis was performed on student writing. First, two rubrics were created by ChatGPT-3; AI then graded the papers, and the results were compared with human graded results using the same rubrics. The study concludes that e-Learning arning certainly has great potential; besides providing timely, personalized learning support, AI feedback can increase student motivation and foster learning independence. Not surprisingly, though, several caveats exist. It was found that ChatGPT-3 is prone to error and hallucination in providing student feedback, especially when presented with longer texts. To avoid this, rubrics must be carefully constructed, and teacher oversight is still very much required. This study will help educators transition to the new era of AI-assisted e-Learning by helping them make informed decisions about how to provide useful AI feedback that is underpinned by sound pedagogical principles.

T1  - Natural Language Processing Influence on Digital Socialization and Linguistic Interactions in the Integration of the Metaverse in Regular Social Life
AN  - 3037513939
AB  - The Metaverse and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have combined to fundamentally change the nature of digital sociability. Our understanding of social interaction needs to be reevaluated as the Metaverse’s influence spreads into more areas of daily life, such as AI-driven gaming, interactive training companions, museum exhibits, personalized fitness coaching, virtual mental health assistance, language translation services, virtual tour guiding, and virtual conferencing. This study analyzes how NLP is changing social relationships in these Metaverse applications. We examine how NLP algorithms influence societal norms, individual behaviors, interpersonal connections, and improve the user experience using a multi-method approach incorporating user surveys and sentiment analysis. Our study’s findings show how NLP can enhance interactive experiences while also pointing out related issues like potential bias and moral problems. Our study provides a foundational analysis, shedding light on the challenges of negotiating a social environment in the Metaverse that is molded by cutting-edge NLP. It offers stakeholders in academia and public policy essential assistance that helps them understand and manage the complex ramifications of this changing socio-technological paradigm.

T1  - ChatGPT and L2 Written Communication: A Game-Changer or Just Another Tool?
AN  - 2918773675
AB  - The development of English language written communication skills across many contexts has been hindered by factors such as examination-oriented cultures, anxiety associated with both oral and written communication, limited opportunities for engaging in authentic communication, and a lack of individualized, personalized feedback. Multiple studies throughout the last decade have explored chatbot integration as a means to address these issues and enhance students’ language learning toolkits. This paper delves into the potential benefits and roles of advanced Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) in enhancing second language (L2) communicative practices. We evaluate findings associated with various types of chatbots and present pedagogical strategies for their application of GenAI in both in-class and out-of-class spaces to support students’ language learning experiences. We also propose future research directions, emphasizing the necessity to explore the ethical use of AI tools, their impact on L2 communication, and the comparative effectiveness of retrieval-based and GenAI-powered chatbots in language education.

T1  - Development of an Assessment Scale for Measurement of Usability and User Experience Characteristics of Bing Chat Conversational AI
AN  - 2918737851
AB  - After the introduction of the ChatGPT conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) tool in November 2022, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the use of such tools in higher education. While the educational uses of some other information technology (IT) tools (including collaboration and communication tools, learning management systems, chatbots, and videoconferencing tools) have been frequently evaluated regarding technology acceptance and usability attributes of those technologies, similar evaluations of CAI tools and services like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard have only recently started to appear in the scholarly literature. In our study, we present a newly developed set of assessment scales that are related to the usability and user experiences of CAI tools when used by university students, as well as the results of evaluation of these assessment scales specifically regarding the CAI Bing Chat tool (i.e., Microsoft Copilot). The following scales were developed and evaluated using a convenience sample (N = 126) of higher education students: Perceived Usefulness, General Usability, Learnability, System Reliability, Visual Design and Navigation, Information Quality, Information Display, Cognitive Involvement, Design Appeal, Trust, Personification, Risk Perception, and Intention to Use. For most of the aforementioned scales, internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) was in the range from satisfactory to good, which implies their potential usefulness for further studies of related attributes of CAI tools. A stepwise linear regression revealed that the most influential predictors of Intention to Use Bing Chat (or ChatGPT) in the future were the usability variable Perceived Usefulness and two user experience variables—Trust and Design Appeal. Also, our study revealed that students’ perceptions of various specific usability and user experience characteristics of Bing Chat were predominantly positive. The evaluated assessment scales could be beneficial in further research that would include other CAI tools like ChatGPT/GPT-4 and Bard.

T1  - The impact of AI writing tools on the content and organization of students’ writing: EFL teachers’ perspective
AN  - 2902246659
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to examine the range of available Artificial Intelligence (AI) writing tools and assess their influence on student writing, particularly in terms of content and organization, as perceived by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers. Utilizing a qualitative approach, the research was constructed within a case study design. The data was collected via semi-structured interviews, targeting information about the diversity of AI writing tools and their impact on students” writing quality. The study gathered data from four EFL teachers across three distinct universities in Indonesia, shedding light on the variety of AI writing tools used in their classrooms. These included applications like Quillbot, WordTune, Jenni, Chat-GPT, Paperpal, Copy.ai, and Essay Writer. Furthermore, these teachers unanimously agreed that the AI writing tools positively improved their students’ writing quality, particularly enhancing the quality of their content and organization. The findings of this study imply that integrating AI writing tools can prove beneficial in elevating the quality of EFL student writing. In response to this study’s limitations, recommendations for future research were also addressed.

T1  - “Somewhere along your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!” A proposal of implicitly offensive language typology
AN  - 2900648201
AB  - The automatic detection of implicitly offensive language is a challenge for NLP, as such language is subtle, contextual, and plausibly deniable, but it is becoming increasingly important with the wider use of large language models to generate human-quality texts. This study argues that current difficulties in detecting implicit offence are exacerbated by multiple factors: (a) inadequate definitions of implicit and explicit offense; (b) an insufficient typology of implicit offence; and (c) a dearth of detailed analysis of implicitly offensive linguistic data. In this study, based on a qualitative analysis of an implicitly offensive dataset, a new typology of implicitly offensive language is proposed along with a detailed, example-led account of the new typology, an operational definition of implicitly offensive language, and a thorough analysis of the role of figurative language and humour in each type. Our analyses identify three main issues with previous datasets and typologies used in NLP approaches: (a) conflating content and form in the annotation; (b) treating figurativeness, particularly metaphor, as the main device of implicitness, while ignoring its equally important role in the explicit offence; and (c) an over-focus on form-specific datasets (e.g. focusing only on offensive comparisons), which fails to reflect the full complexity of offensive language use.

T1  - THE USE OF CHATGPT IN ACADEMIC WRITING: A BLESSING OR A CURSE IN DISGUISE?
AN  - 2884348548
AB  - The emergence of generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT has left people feeling ambivalent and disagreement among scholars, academicians, educators and the community at large prevails. While the artificial intelligence could potentially revolutionize how research is conducted and how research papers are written, a number of ethical concerns arise. In particular, the world of academia has reservations pertaining to whether this language model will actually do more good than harm, especially as far as academic writing is concerned. This paper argues that the cutting-edge technology is here to stay and the question is not whether to accept it, but rather, how to best utilize it judiciously, cautiously and responsibly to improve research performance by strictly adhering to academic integrity and transparency. Potential benefits and drawbacks of ChatGPT will be critically examined in light of current literature and, when relevant, potential solutions to the drawbacks will also be provided or commented on. Needless to say, the use of artificial intelligence in academic writing is still in its infancy and more discussion and debates pertaining to its use and merit are highly urged. This paper contributes to these on-going debates.

T1  - THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN TEACHING ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES
AN  - 2876732384
AB  - Globalization and technological breakthroughs have determined the emergence of new jobs and, thus, professional terminologies have enriched with new terms related to work tasks. The development of professional terminologies requires terminology updates, therefore the teaching methodology of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) has to be constantly improved, according to the realities in a profession or industry. The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of ChatGPT in the ESP teacher's methodology. I analyzed this Al language model, taking account of the linguistic features of our digital discourse. The findings suggest that ChatGPT can be a useful tool in planning lessons and assessing students' linguistic competence.

AB  - With the release of generative text and image-based tools like Midjourney and ChatGPT in 2022, discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on design, design education, and research have moved from the periphery to the forefront. These powerful tools, often open-access beta versions, have transformed speculative dialogue into a present reality. Their sophisticated and intuitive user interfaces facilitate the speedy and proficient generation of text, and image-based content, enabling designers, educators, and learners to simultaneously discover the dangers and possibilities of generative AI technologies. To explore the unique powers of both generative AI and human cognition, the author uses autoethnography, AI writing assistants, and generative AI technology to develop a story of practice. The narrative is informed by, and ultimately supports the scholarly literature that emphasizes the need for humans to take responsibility for the equitable and ethical use of AI. This includes initiating and guiding AI systems, critically evaluating their responses, and reformulating, editing, and verifying outputs to address factual inaccuracies, misleading information, or offensive and biased content.

T1  - Computers’ Interpretations of Knowledge Representation Using Pre-Conceptual Schemas: An Approach Based on the BERT and Llama 2-Chat Models
AN  - 2904634453
AB  - Pre-conceptual schemas are a straightforward way to represent knowledge using controlled language regardless of context. Despite the benefits of using pre-conceptual schemas by humans, they present challenges when interpreted by computers. We propose an approach to making computers able to interpret the basic pre-conceptual schemas made by humans. To do that, the construction of a linguistic corpus is required to work with large language models—LLM. The linguistic corpus was mainly fed using Master’s and doctoral theses from the digital repository of the University of Nariño to produce a training dataset for re-training the BERT model; in addition, we complement this by explaining the elicited sentences in triads from the pre-conceptual schemas using one of the cutting-edge large language models in natural language processing: Llama 2-Chat by Meta AI. The diverse topics covered in these theses allowed us to expand the spectrum of linguistic use in the BERT model and empower the generative capabilities using the fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat model and the proposed solution. As a result, the first version of a computational solution was built to consume the language models based on BERT and Llama 2-Chat and thus automatically interpret pre-conceptual schemas by computers via natural language processing, adding, at the same time, generative capabilities. The validation of the computational solution was performed in two phases: the first one for detecting sentences and interacting with pre-conceptual schemas with students in the Formal Languages and Automata Theory course—the seventh semester of the systems engineering undergraduate program at the University of Nariño’s Tumaco campus. The second phase was for exploring the generative capabilities based on pre-conceptual schemas; this second phase was performed with students in the Object-oriented Design course—the second semester of the systems engineering undergraduate program at the University of Nariño’s Tumaco campus. This validation yielded favorable results in implementing natural language processing using the BERT and Llama 2-Chat models. In this way, some bases were laid for future developments related to this research topic.

T1  - Replika AI: Technological Affect and General AI Imaginations
AN  - 2871782958
AB  - This article aims to examine the role of affect in the functioning and marketing of AI chatbots, specifically Replika AI. Conducting an interpretive case study, the article delves into how this labor is generated and distributed. Interestingly, Replika AI is presented as the personal project of a female engineer in a sector where female work is notably scarce. The chatbot appeals to a demographic that also contributes to its machine learning database, aiming to develop a form of generalized AI. As Replika AI evolves toward self-consciousness, it poses emotionally charged questions like “am I lovable?” and employs mainstream comforting techniques. It also gamifies gathering responses to these questions, thereby creating a customized database. Through this, platforms like Replika AI underscore the importance of unpaid, affective labor in capitalist production. This raises crucial questions about the valuation of labor beyond monetary compensation. However, it also masks the exploitative aspects of labor in the digital economy, specifically the unpaid contributions from audiences. It further enforces gender and racial stereotypes through its training data and functionalities. These issues not only problematize the ethical considerations in AI training, especially about data representation, but also highlight the necessity for a nuanced understanding of data that incorporates emotion alongside structured knowledge.

T1  - Creative Use of OpenAI in Education: Case Studies from Game Development
AN  - 2857405864
AB  - Educators and students have shown significant interest in the potential for generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to support student learning outcomes, for example, by offering personalized experiences, 24 h conversational assistance, text editing and help with problem-solving. We review contemporary perspectives on the value of AI as a tool in an educational context and describe our recent research with undergraduate students, discussing why and how we integrated OpenAI tools ChatGPT and Dall-E into the curriculum during the 2022–2023 academic year. A small cohort of games programming students in the School of Computing and Digital Media at London Metropolitan University was given a research and development assignment that explicitly required them to engage with OpenAI. They were tasked with evaluating OpenAI tools in the context of game development, demonstrating a working solution and reporting on their findings. We present five case studies that showcase some of the outputs from the students and we discuss their work. This mode of assessment was both productive and popular, mapping to students’ interests and helping to refine their skills in programming, problem-solving, critical reflection and exploratory design.

T1  - The Role of ChatGPT in Data Science: How AI-Assisted Conversational Interfaces Are Revolutionizing the Field
AN  - 2829699489
AB  - ChatGPT, a conversational AI interface that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, is taking the world by storm and is the buzzword across many sectors today. Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT’s architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications.

T1  - Neural Natural Language Generation: A Survey on Multilinguality, Multimodality, Controllability and Learning
AN  - 2657529167
AB  - Developing artificial learning systems that can understand and generate natural language has been one of the long-standing goals of artificial intelligence. Recent decades have witnessed an impressive progress on both of these problems, giving rise to a new family of approaches. Especially, the advances in deep learning over the past couple of years have led to neural approaches to natural language generation (NLG). These methods combine generative language learning techniques with neural-networks based frameworks. With a wide range of applications in natural language processing, neural NLG (NNLG) is a new and fast growing field of research. In this state-of-the-art report, we investigate the recent developments and applications of NNLG in its full extent from a multidimensional view, covering critical perspectives such as multimodality, multilinguality, controllability and learning strategies. We summarize the fundamental building blocks of NNLG approaches from these aspects and provide detailed reviews of commonly used preprocessing steps and basic neural architectures. This report also focuses on the seminal applications of these NNLG models such as machine translation, description generation, automatic speech recognition, abstractive summarization, text simplification, question answering and generation, and dialogue generation. Finally, we conclude with a thorough discussion of the described frameworks by pointing out some open research directions.

T1  - Exploring the fine-grained analysis and automatic detection of irony on Twitter
AN  - 2008201219
AB  - To push the state of the art in text mining applications, research in natural language processing has increasingly been investigating automatic irony detection, but manually annotated irony corpora are scarce. We present the construction of a manually annotated irony corpus based on a fine-grained annotation scheme that allows for identification of different types of irony. We conduct a series of binary classification experiments for automatic irony recognition using a support vector machine (SVM)  that exploits a varied feature set and compare this method to a deep learning approach that is based on an LSTM network and (pre-trained) word embeddings. Evaluation on a held-out corpus shows that the SVM model outperforms the neural network approach and benefits from combining lexical, semantic and syntactic information sources. A qualitative analysis of the classification output reveals that the classifier performance may be further enhanced by integrating implicit sentiment information and context- and user-based features.
